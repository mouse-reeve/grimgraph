## The Epistle

### To the Honorable, mine especiall good Lord, Sir Roger Manwood Knight, Lord cheefe Baron of hir Majesties Court of the Eschequer.

Insomuch as I know that your Lordship is by nature
whollie inclined, and in purpose earnestly bent to releeve
the poore, and that not onlie with hospitalitie and almes,
but by diverse other devises and waies tending to their
comfort, having (as it were) framed and set your selfe to the helpe and
maintenance of their estate; as appeareth by your charge and travell
in that behalfe. Whereas also you have a speciall care for the supporting
of their right, and redressing of their wrongs, as neither
despising their calamitie, nor yet forgetting their complaint, seeking
all meanes for their amendement, and for the reformation of their disorders,
even as a verie father to the poore. Finallie, for that I am a
poore member of that commonwelth, where your Lordship is a
principall person; I thought this my travell, in the behalfe of the poore,
the aged, and the simple, might be verie fitlie commended unto you:
for a weake house requireth a strong staie. In which respect I give
God thanks, that hath raised up unto me so mightie a freend for them
as your Lordship is, who in our lawes have such knowledge, in
government such discretion, in these causes such experience, and in
the commonwealth such authoritie; and neverthelesse vouchsafe to
descend to the consideration of these base and inferior matters, which
minister more care and trouble, than worldlie estimation.

And in somuch as your Lordship knoweth, or rather exerciseth the
office of a judge, whose part it is to heare with courtesie, and to
determine with equitie; it cannot but be apparent unto you, that when
punishment exceedeth the fault, it is rather to be thought vengeance
than correction. In which respect I knowe you spend more time and
travell in the conversion and reformation, than in the subversion &
confusion of offenders, as being well pleased to augment your
owne private paines, to the end you may diminish their publike smart.
For in truth, that commonwealth remaineth in wofull state, where
fetters and halters beare more swaie than mercie and due compassion.

Howbeit, it is naturall to unnaturall people, and peculiar unto
witchmongers, to pursue the poore, to accuse the simple, and to kill
the innocent; supplieng in rigor and malice towards others, that
which they themselves want in proofe and discretion, or the other in
offense or occasion. But as a cruell hart and an honest mind doo
seldome meete and feed togither in a dish; so a discreet and mercifull
magistrate, and a happie commonwealth cannot be separated asunder.
How much then are we bound to God, who hath given us a Queene,
that of justice is not only the very perfect image & paterne; but also
of mercie & clemencie (under God) the meere fountaine & bodie it
selfe? In somuch as they which hunt most after bloud in these
daies, have least authoritie to shed it. Moreover, sith I see that in
cases where lenitie might be noisome, & punishment wholesome to
the commonwealth; there no respect of person can move you, no
authoritie can abash you, no feare, no threts can daunt you in performing
the dutie of justice.

In that respect againe I find your Lordship a fit person, to judge
and looke upon this present treatise. Wherein I will bring before
you, as it were to the barre, two sorts of most arrogant and wicked
people, the first challenging to themselves, the second attributing unto
others, that power which onelie apperteineth to God, who onelie is
Creator of all things, who onelie searcheth the heart and reines,
who onelie knoweth our imaginations and thoughts, who onelie
openeth all secrets, who onelie worketh great wonders, who onelie
hath power to raise up & cast downe; who onelie maketh thunder,
lightning, raine, tempests, and restraineth them at his pleasure; who
onelie sendeth life and death, sicknesse & health, wealth and wo;
who neither giveth nor lendeth his glorie to anie creature.

And therefore, that which greeveth me to the bottome of my hart,
is, that these witchmongers cannot be content, to wrest out of Gods
hand his almightie power, and keepe it themselves, or leave it with a
witch: but that, when by drift of argument they are made to laie
downe the bucklers, they yeeld them up to the divell, or at the least
praie aid of him, as though the raines of all mens lives and actions
were committed into his hand; and that he sat at the sterne, to guide
and direct the course of the whole world, imputing unto him power
and abilitie inough to doo as great things, and as strange miracles as
ever Christ did.

But the doctors of this supernaturall doctrine saie somtimes, that
the witch doth all these things by vertue of hir charmes; sometimes
that a spirituall, sometimes that a corporall divell doth accomplish it;
sometimes they saie that the divell doth but make the witch beleeve
she doth that which he himselfe hath wrought; sometimes that the
divell seemeth to doo that by compulsion, which he doth most
willinglie. Finallie, the writers hereupon are so eloquent, and full of
varietie; that sometimes they write that the divell dooth all this by
Gods permission onelie; sometimes by his licence, somtimes by his
appointment: so as (in effect and truth) not the divell, but the high
and mightie king of kings, and Lord of hosts, even God himselfe,
should this waie be made obedient and servile to obeie and performe
the will & commandement of a malicious old witch, and miraculouslie
to answere hir appetite, as well in everie trifling vanitie, as in most
horrible executions; as the revenger of a doting old womans imagined
wrongs, to the destruction of mania innocent children, and as a
supporter of hir passions, to the undoing of manie a poore soule.
And I see not, but a witch may as well inchant, when she will; as a
lier may lie when he list: and so should we possesse nothing, but by
a witches licence and permission.

And now forsooth it is brought to this point, that all divels, which
were woont to be spirituall, may at their pleasure become corporall,
and so shew themselves familiarlie to witches and conjurors, and to
none other, and by them onlie may be made tame, and kept in a box,
&c. So as a malicious old woman may command hir divell to plague
hir neighbor: and he is afflicted in manner and forme as she desireth.
But then commeth another witch, and she biddeth hir divell helpe,
and he healeth the same partie. So as they make it a kingdome
divided in it selfe, and therefore I trust it will not long endure, but
will shortlie be overthrowne, according to the words of our Savior,
_Omne regnum in se divisum desolabitur_, Everie kingdome divided in
it selfe shalbe desolate.

And although some saie that the divell is the witches instrument,
to bring hir purposes and practises to passe: yet others saie that she
is his instrument, to execute his pleasure in anie thing, and therefore
to be executed. But then (me thinks) she should be injuriouslie dealt
withall, and put to death for anothers offense : for actions are not
judged by instrumentall causes; neither dooth the end and purpose
of that which is done, depend upon the meane instrument. Finallie,
if the witch doo it not, why should the witch die for it? But they saie
that witches are persuaded, and thinke, that they doo indeed those
mischeefs; and have a will to performe that which the divell committeth:
and that therefore they are worthie to die. By which reason
everie one should be executed, that wisheth evill to his neighbor, &c.
But if the will should be punished by man, according to the offense
against God, we should be driven by thousands at once to the
slaughterhouse or butcherie. For whosoever loatheth correction
shall die. And who should escape execution, if this lothsomnesse (I
saie) should extend to death by the civill lawes. Also the reward of
sinne is death. Howbeit, everie one that sinneth, is not to be put to
death by the magistrate. But (my Lord) it shalbe proved in my
booke, and your Lordship shall trie it to be true, as well here at home
in your native countrie, as also abrode in your severall circuits, that
(besides them that be _Venificæ_, which are plaine poisoners) there will
be found among our witches onelie two sorts; the one sort being such
by imputation, as so thought of by others (and these are abused, and
not abusors) the other by acceptation, as being willing so to be
accompted (and these be meere cousenors.)

Calvine treating of these magicians, calleth them cousenors, saieng
that they use their juggling knacks onelie to amase or abuse the
people; or else for fame: but he might rather have said for gaine.
Erastus himselfe, being a principall writer in the behalfe of witches
omnipotencie, is forced to confesse, that these Greeke words, {G},
{G}, {G}, are most commonlie put for illusion, false packing,
cousenage, fraud, knaverie and deceipt: and is further driven to saie,
that in ancient time, the learned were not so blockish, as not to see
that the promises of magicians and inchanters were false, and nothing
else but knaverie, cousenage, and old wives fables; and yet
defendeth he their flieng in the aire, their transferring of corne or
grasse from one feeld to another, &c.

But as Erastus disagreeth herein with himselfe and his freends: so
is there no agreement among anie of those writers, but onlie in
cruelties, absurdities, and impossibilities. And these (my Lord) that
fall into so manifest contradictions, and into such absurd asseverations,
are not of the inferior sort of witers; neither are they all
papists, but men of such accompt, as whose names give more credit
to their cause, than their writings. In whose behalfe I am sorie, and
partlie for reverence suppresse their fondest errors and fowlest absurdities;
dealing speciallie with them that most contend in crueltie,
whose feete are swift to shed bloud, striving (as Jesus the sonne of
Sirach saith) and hasting (as Salomon the sonne of David saith) to
powre out the bloud of the innocent; whose heat against these poore
wretches cannot be allaied with anie other liquor than bloud. And
therfore I feare that under their wings will be found the bloud of the
soules of the poore, at that daie, when the Lord shall saie; Depart
from me ye bloadthirstie men.

And bicause I know your Lordship will take no counsell against
innocent bloud, but rather suppresse them that seeke to embrue their
hands therein; I have made choise to open their case unto you, and
to laie their miserable calamitie before your feete : following herein
the advise of that learned man Brentius, who saith; _Si quis admonuerit
magistratum, ne in miseras illas mulierculas saviat, eum ego
arbitror divinitùs excitatum_; that is. If anie admonish the magistrate
not to deale too hardlie with these miserable wretches, that are called
witches, I thinke him a good instrument raised up for this purpose by
God himselfe.

But it will perchance be said by witchmongers; to wit, by such as
attribute to witches the power which apperteineth to God onelie, that
I have made choise of your Lordship to be a patrone to this my booke;
bicause I think you favour mine opinions, and by that meanes may
the more freelie publish anie error or conceipt of mine owne, which
should rather be warranted by your Lordships authoritie, than by the
word of God, or by sufficient argument. But I protest the contrarie,
and by these presents I renounce all protection, and despise all freendship
that might serve to helpe towards the suppressing or supplanting
of truth: knowing also that your Lordship is farre from allowing anie
injurie done unto man; much more an enimie to them that go about
to dishonor God, or to embezill the title of his immortall glorie. But
bicause I know you to be perspicuous, and able to see downe into the
depth and bottome of causes, and are not to be carried awaie with the
vaine persuasion or superstition either of man, custome, time, or
multitude, but mooved with the authoritie of truth onlie: I crave
your countenance herein, even so farre foorth, and no further, than
the lawe of God, the lawe of nature, the lawe of this land, and the rule
of reason shall require. Neither doo I treat for these poore people
anie otherwise, but so, as with one hand you may sustaine the good,
and with the other suppresse the evill: wherein you shalbe thought a
father to orphans, an advocate to widowes, a guide to the blind, a
staie to the lame, a comfort & countenance to the honest, a scourge
and terror to the wicked.

Thus farre I have beene bold to use your Lordships patience, being
offended with my selfe, that I could not in brevitie utter such matter
as I have delivered amplie: whereby (I confesse) occasion of tediousnes
might be ministred, were it not that your great gravitie joined
with your singular constancie in reading and judging be means of
the contrarie. And I wish even with all my hart, that I could make
people conceive the substance of my writing, and not to misconstrue
anie part of my meaning. Then doubtles would I persuade my selfe,
that the companie of witchmongers, &c: being once decreased, the
number also of witches, &c: would soone be diminished. But true
be the words of the Poet,

> Haudquaquam poteris sortirier omnia solus,  
> Námque aliis divi bello pollere dederunt.  
> Huic saltandi artem, voce huic cytharáque canendi:  
> Rursum alii inseruit sagax in pectore magnus  
> Jupiter ingenium, &c.

And therefore as doubtfull to prevaile by persuading, though I have
reason and common sense on my side; I rest upon earnest wishing;
namelie, to all people an absolute trust in God the creator, and not
in creatures, which is to make flesh our arme: that God may
have his due honor, which by the undutifulnes of manie
is turned into dishonor, and lesse cause of offense
and errour given by common received evill
example. And to your Lordship I wish, as
increase of honour, so continuance of good health,
and happie daies.

Your Lordships to be commanded

Reginald Scot.


### To the right worshipfull Sir Thomas Scot Knight, &c.

Sir, I see among other malefactors manie poore old women
convented before you for working of miracles, other
wise called witchcraft, and therefore I thought you also a
meet person to whom I might comend my booke. And
here I have occasion to speake of your sincere administration of justice,
and of your dexteritie, discretion, charge, and travell emploied in that
behalfe, wherof I am oculatus testis. Howbeit I had rather refer the
reader to common fame, and their owne eies and eares to be satisfied
than to send them to a Stationers shop, where manie times lies are
vendible, and truth contemptible. For I being of your house, of your
name, & of your bloud y my foot being under your table, my hand in
your dish, or rather in your pursse, might bee thought to flatter you in
that, wherein (I knowe) I should rather offend you than please you.
And what need I currie favour with my most assured friend? And if
I should onelie publish those vertues (though they be manie) which
give me speciall occasion to exhibit this my travell unto you, I should
doo as a painter, that describeth the foot of a notable personage, and
leaveth all the best features in his bodie untouched.

I therefore (at this time) doo onelie desire you to consider of my
report, concerning the evidence that is commonlie brought before you
against them. See first whether the evidence be not frivolous, &
whether the proofs brought against them be not incredible, consisting
of ghesses, presumptions, & impossibilities contrarie to reason, scripture,
and nature. See also what persons complaine upon them,
whether they be not of the basest, the unwisest, & most faithles kind
of people. Also may it please you to waie what accusations and
crimes they laie to their charge, namelie: She was at my house of
late, she would have had a pot of milke, she departed in a chafe
bicause she had it not, she railed, she curssed, she mumbled and
whispered, and finallie she said she would be even with me: and
soone after my child, my cow, my sow, or my pullet died, or was
strangelie taken. Naie (if it please your Worship) I have further
proofe: I was with a wise woman, and she told me I had an ill
neighbour, & that she would come to my house yer it were long, and
so did she; and that she had a marke above hir waste, & so had she:
and God forgive me, my stomach hath gone against hir a great while.
Hir mother before hir was counted a witch, she hath beene beaten
and scratched by the face till bloud was drawne upon hir, bicause she
hath beene suspected, & afterwards some of those persons were
said to amend. These are the certeinties that I heare in their evidences.

Note also how easilie they may be brought to confesse that which
they never did, nor lieth in the power of man to doo: and then see
whether I have cause to write as I doo. Further, if you shall see
that infidelitie, poperie, and manie other manifest heresies be backed
and shouldered, and their professors animated and hartened, by
yeelding to creatures such infinit power as is wrested out of Gods
hand, and attributed to witches: finallie, if you shall perceive that I
have faithfullie and trulie delivered and set downe the condition and
state of the witch, and also of the witchmonger, and have confuted
by reason and lawe, and by the word of God it selfe, all mine adversaries
objections and arguments: then let me have your countenance
against them that maliciouslie oppose themselves against me.

My greatest adversaries are yoong ignorance and old custome.
For what follie soever tract of time hath fostered, it is so superstitiouslie
pursued of some, as though no error could be acquainted with
custome. But if the lawe of nations would joine with such custome, to
the maintenance of ignorance, and to the suppressing of knowledge;
the civilest countrie in the world would soone become barbarous, &c.
For as knowledge and time discovereth errors, so dooth superstition
and ignorance in time breed them. And concerning the opinions of
such, as wish that ignorance should rather be mainteined, than knowledge
busilie searched for, bicause thereby offence may grow: I
answer, that we are commanded by Christ himselfe to search for
knowledge: for it is the kings honour (as Salomon saith) to search
out a thing.

Aristotle said to Alexander, that a mind well furnished was more
beautifull than a bodie richlie araied. What can be more odious to
man, or offensive to God, than ignorance: for through ignorance the
Jewes did put Christ to death. Which ignorance whosoever forsaketh,
is promised life everlasting: and therfore among Christians it should
be abhorred above all other things. For even as when we wrestle
in the darke, we tumble in the mire, &c: so when we see not the
truth, we wallow in errors. A blind man may seeke long in the rishes
yer he find a needle; and as soone is a doubt discussed by ignorance.
Finallie, truth is no sooner found out in ignorance, than a sweet savor
in a dunghill. And if they will allow men knowledge, and give them
no leave to use it, men were much better be without it than have it.
For it is, as to have a tallent, and to hide it under the earth; or to
candle under a bushell: or as to have a ship, & to let hir lie
alwaies in the docke: which thing how profitable it is, I can saie
somewhat by experience.

But hereof I need saie no more, for everie man seeth that
none can be happie who knoweth not what felicitie meaneth.
For what availeth it to have riches, and not to have the use
thereof? Trulie the heathen herein deserved more commendation
than manie christians, for they spared no paine, no cost, nor
travell to atteine to knowledge. Pythagoras travelled from Thamus
to Aegypt, and afterwards into Crete and Lacedæmonia: and Plato
out of Athens into Italie and Aegypt, and all to find out hidden
secrets and knowledge: which when a man hath, he seemeth to be
separated from mortalitie. For pretious stones, and all other creatures
of what value soever, are but counterfeits to this jewell: they
are mortall, corruptible, and inconstant this is immortall, pure
and certeine. Wherfore if I have searched and found out any
good thing, that ignorance and time hath smothered,
the same I commend unto you: to whom
though I owe all that I have, yet am
I bold to make other partakers with you in
this poore gift.

Your loving cousen,

Reg. Scot.


### To the right worshipfull his loving friends, Maister Doctor Coldwell Deane of Rochester, and Maister Doctor Readman Archdeacon of Canturburie, &c.

Having found out two such civill Magistrates, as for
direction of judgement, and for ordering matters con-
cerning justice in this common weakh (in my poore
opinion) are verie singular persons, who (I hope) will
accept of my good will, and examine my booke by their experience,
as unto whom the matter therin conteined dooth greatlie apperteine:
I have now againe considered of two other points: namelie, divinitie
and philosophic, whereupon the groundworke of my booke is laid.
Wherein although I know them to be verie sufficientlie informed,
yet dooth not the judgement and censure of those causes so properlie
apperteine to them as unto you, whose fame therein hath gotten
preeminence above all others that I know of your callings: and in
that respect I am bold to joine you with them, being all good neighbours
togither in this commonwelth, and loving friends unto me.
I doo not present this unto you, bicause it is meet for youy but for
that you are meet for it (I meane) to judge upon it, to defend it, and
if need be to correct ity knowing that you have learned of that grave
counseller Cato, not to shame or discountenance any bodie. For if
I thought you as readie, as able, to disgrace me for mine insufficien-
cies I should not have beene hastie (knowing your learning) to have
written unto you: but if I should be abashed to write to you, I should
shew my selfe ignorant of your courtesie.

I knowe mine owne weakenesse, which if it have beene able to
mainteine this argument, the cause is the stronger. Eloquent words
may please the eares, but sufficient matter persuadeth the hart. So
as, if I exhibit wholsome drinke (thought it be small) in a treene
dish with a faithfull hand, I hope it will bee as well accepted, as
strong wine offered in a silver bowle with a flattering heart. And
surelie it is a point of as great liberalitie to receive a small thing
thankefullie, as to give and distribute great and costlie gifts bountifullie:
for there is more supplied with courteous answers than with
rich rewards. The tyrant Dionysius was not so hated for his
tyrannie, as for his churlish and strange behaviour. Among the
poore Israelites sacrifices, God was satisfied with the tenth part of
an Ephah of flower, so as it were fine and good. Christ liked well
of the poore widowes mite, Lewis of France accepted a rape root of
clownish Conan, Cyrus vouchsafed to drinke a cup of cold water out
of the hand of poore Sinætes: and so it may please you to accept
this simple booke at my hands, which I faithfullie exhibit unto you,
not knowing your opinions to meet with mine, but knowing your
learning and judgement to be able as well to correct me where I
speake herein unskilfullie, as others when they speake hereof maliciouslie.

Some be such dogs as they will barke at my writings, whether I
mainteine or refute this argument: as Diogenes snarled both at the
Rhodians and at the Lacedæmonians: at the one, bicause they were
bravey at the other, bicause they were not brave. Homer himselfe
could not avoid reprochfull speaches. I am sure that they which
never studied to learne anie good thing, will studie to find faults
hereat. I for my part feare not these wars, nor all the adversaries I
havey were it not for certeine cowards, who (I knowe) will come
behind my backe and bite me.

But now to the matter. My question is not (as manie fondlie
suppose) whether there be witches or naie: but whether they can
doo such miraculous works as are imputed unto them. Good Maister
Deane, is it possible for a man to breake his fast with you at
Rochester, and to dine that day at Durham with Maister Doctor
Matthew; or can your enimie maime you, when the Ocean sea is
betwixt you? What reall communitie is betwixt a spirit and a bodie?
May a spirituall bodie become temporall at his pleasure? Or may a
carnall bodie become invisible? Is it likelie that the lives of all
Princes, magistrates, & subjects, should depend upon the will, or
rather upon the wish of a poore malicious doting old foole; and that
power exempted from the wise, the rich, the learned, the godlie, &c?
Finallie, is it possible for man or woman to do anie of those miracles
expressed in my booke, & so constantlie reported by great clarks?
If you saie, no; then am I satisfied. If you saie that God, absolutelie,
or by meanes can accomplish all those, and manie more, I
go with you. But witches may well saie they can doo these things,
howbeit they cannot shew how they doo them. If I for my part
should saie I could doo those things, my verie adversaries would saie
that I lied.

O Maister Archdeacon, is it not pitie, that that which is said to be
doone with the almightie power of the most high God, and by our
saviour his onelie sonne Jesus Christ our Lord, shouldbe referred to
a baggage old womans nod or wish, &c ? Good Sir, is it not one
manifest kind of Idolatrie, for them that labor and are laden, to come
unto witches to be refreshed? If witches could helpe whom they
are said to have made sicke, I see no reason, but remedie might as
well be required at their hands, as a pursse demanded of him that
hath stolne it. But trulie it is manifold idolatrie, to aske that of a
creature, which none can give but the Creator. The papist hath
some colour of scripture to mainteine his idoll of bread, but no
Jesuiticall distinction can cover the witchmongers idolatrie in this
behalfe. Alas, I am sorie and ashamed to see how manie die, that
being said to be bewitched, onelie seeke for magicall cures, whom
wholsome diet and good medicines would have recovered. I dare
assure you both, that there would be none of these cousening kind
of witches, did not witchmongers mainteine them, followe them, and
beleeve in them and their oracles: whereby indeed all good learning
and honest arts are overthrowne. For these that most advance their
power, and mainteine the skill of these witches, understand no part
thereof: and yet being manie times wise in other matters, are made
fooles by the most fooles in the world.

Me thinks these magicall physicians deale in the commonwelth,
much like as a certeine kind of Cynicall people doo in the church,
whose severe saiengs are accompted among some such oracles, as
may not be doubted of; who in stead of learning and authoritie
(which they make contemptible) doo feed the people with their owne
devises and imaginations, which they prefer before all other divinitie:
and labouring to erect a church according to their owne fansies,
wherein all order is condemned, and onelie their magicall words and
curious directions advanced, they would utterlie overthrowe the true
Church. And even as these inchanting Paracelsians abuse the
people, leading them from the true order of physicke to their
charmes: so doo these other (I saie) dissuade from hearkening to
learning and obedience, and whisper in mens eares to teach them
their frierlike traditions. And of this sect the cheefe author at this
time is one Browne, a fugitive, a meet cover for such a cup: as heretofore
the Anabaptists, the Arrians, and the Franciscane friers.

Trulie not onlie nature, being the foundation of all perfection;
but also scripture, being the mistresse and director thereof, and of
all christianitie, is beautified with knowledge and learning. For as
nature without discipline dooth naturallie incline unto vanities, and
as it were sucke up errors: so doth the word, or rather the letter of
the scripture, without understanding, not onlie make us devoure
errors, but yeeldeth us up to death & destruction: & therefore
Paule saith he was not a minister of the letter, but of the spirit.
Thus have I beene bold to deliver unto the world, and to you, those
simple notes, reasons, and arguments, which I have devised or collected
out of other authors: which I hope shall be hurtfull to none,
but to my selfe great comfort, if it may passe with good liking and
acceptation. If it fall out otherwise, I should thinke my paines ill
imploied. For trulie, in mine opinion, whosoever shall performe any
thing, or atteine to anie knowledge; or whosoever should travell
throughout all the nations of the world, or (if it were possible) should
peepe into the heavens, the consolation or admiration thereof were
nothing pleasant unto him, unles he had libertie to impart his knowledge
to his friends. Wherein bicause I have made speciall choise
of you, I hope you will read it, or at the least laie it up in your studie
with your other bookes, among which there is none dedicated
to any with more good will. And so long as you
have it, it shall be unto you (upon adventure of my life) a certeine amulet,
periapt, circle, charme, &c:
to defend you from
all inchantments.

Your loving friend
Reg. Scot.


## To the Readers.

To you that are wise & discreete few words may suffice:
for such a one judgeth not at the first sight, nor reprooveth
by heresaie; but patientlie heareth, and thereby
increaseth in understanding: which patience bringeth
foorth experience, whereby true judgement is directed. I shall not
need therefore to make anie further sute to you, but that it would
please you to read my booke, without the prejudice of time, or former
conceipt: and having obteined this at your hands, I submit my selfe
unto your censure. But to make a solemne sute to you that are
parciall readers, desiring you to set aside parcialitie, to take in good
part my writing, and with indifferent eies to looke upon my booke,
were labour lost, and time ill imploied. For I should no more pre-
vaile herein, than if a hundred yeares since I should have intreated
your predecessors to beleeve, that Robin goodfellowe, that great and
ancient bulbegger, had beene but a cousening merchant, and no
divell indeed.

If I should go to a papist, and saie; I praie you beleeve my
writings, wherein I will proove all popish charmes, conjurations,
exorcismes, benedictions and cursses, not onelie to be ridiculous,
and of none effect, but also to be impious and contrarie to Gods
word : I should as hardlie therein win favour at their hands, as herein
obteine credit at yours. Neverthelesse, I doubt not, but to use
the matter so, that as well the massemoonger for his part, as the
witchmoonger for his, shall both be ashamed of their professions.

But Robin goodfellowe ceaseth now to be much feared, and poperie
is sufficientlie discovered. Nevertheles, witches charms, and conjurors
cousenages are yet thought effectuall. Yea the Gentiles have
espied the fraud of their cousening oracles, and our cold prophets
and inchanters make us fooles still, to the shame of us all, but
speciallie of papists, who conjure everie thing, and thereby bring to
passe nothing. They saie to their candles; I conjure you to endure
for ever: and yet they last not a pater noster while the longer. They
conjure water to be wholesome both for bodie and soule: but the
bodie (we see) is never the better for it, nor the soule anie whit
reformed by it. And therefore I mervell, that when they see their
owne conjurations confuted and brought to naught, or at the least
void of effect, that they (of all other) will yet give such credit, countenance,
and authoritie to the vaine cousenages of witches and conjurors;
as though their charmes and conjurations could produce more
apparent, certeine, and better effects than their owne.

But my request unto all you that read my booke shall be no more,
but that it would please you to conferre my words with your owne
sense and experience, and also with the word of God. If you find
your selves resolved and satisfied, or rather reformed and qualified
in anie one point or opinion, that heretofore you held contrarie to
truth, in a matter hitherto undecided, and never yet looked into; I
praie you take that for advantage: and suspending your judgement,
staie the sentence of condemnation against me, and consider of the
rest, at your further leasure. If this may not suffice to persuade you,
it cannot prevaile to annoy you: and then, that which is written without
offense, may be overpassed without anie greefe.

And although mine assertion, be somewhat differing from the old
inveterat opinion, which I confesse hath manie graie heares, whereby
mine adversaries have gained more authoritie than reason, towards
the maintenance of their presumptions and old wives fables: yet
shall it fullie agree with Gods glorie, and with his holie word. And
albeit there be hold taken by mine adversaries of certeine few words
or sentences in the scripture that maketh a shew for them: yet when
the whole course thereof maketh against them, and impugneth the
same, yea and also their owne places rightlie understood doo nothing
at all releeve them: I trust their glorious title and argument of
antiquitie will appeare as stale and corrupt as the apothecaries drugs,
or grocers spice, which the longer they be preserved, the woorsse they
are. And till you have perused my booke, ponder this in your mind,
to wit, that Sages, Thessalce, Striges, Lamia (which words and none
other being in use do properlie signifie our witches) are not once
found written in the old or new testament; and that Christ himselfe
in his gospell never mentioned the name of a witch. And that neither
he, nor Moses ever spake anie one word of the witches bargaine with
the divell, their bagging, their riding in the aire, their transferring of
corne or grasse from one feeld to another, their hurting of children
or cattell with words or charmes, their bewitching of butter, cheese,
ale, &c: nor yet their transubstantiation; insomuch as the writers
hereupon are not ashamed to say, that it is not absurd to affirme that
there were no witches in Jobs time. The reason is, that if there had
beene such witches then in beeing, Job would have said he had beene
bewitched. But indeed men tooke no heed in those daies to this

1. Pet. 4. 1. doctrine of divels ; to wit, to these fables of witchcraft, which Peter

saith shall be much regarded and hearkened unto in the latter daies.
Howbeit, how ancient so ever this barbarous conceipt of witches
omnipotencie is, truth must not be measured by time : for everie old
opinion is not sound. Veritie is not impaired, how long so ever it be
suppressed ; but is to be searched out, in how darke a corner so ever
it lie hidden : for it is not like a cup of ale, that may be broched too
rathe. Finallie, time bewraieth old errors, & discovereth new matters
of truth. Danaeus himselfe saith, that this question hitherto hath
never beene handled ; nor the scriptures concerning this matter have
never beene expounded. To prove the antiquitie of the cause, to
B 2 confirme the opinion of the ignorant, to inforce mine adversaries
arguments, to aggravate the punishments, & to accomplish the con-
fusio of these old women, is added the vanitie and wickednes of
them, which are called witches, the arrogancie of those which take
B. iii. V. upon them to worke wonders, the desire that people have to hearken
to such miraculous matters, unto whome most commonlie an impos-
sibilitie is more credible than a veritie ; the ignorance of naturall
causes, the ancient and universall hate conceived against the name
of a witch ; their ilfavoured faces, their spitefull words, their cursses
and imprecations, their charmes made in ryme, and their beggerie ;
the feare of manie foolish folke, the opinion of some that are wise,
the want of Robin goodfellowe and the fairies, which were woont to
mainteine chat, and the common peoples talke in this behalfe ; the
authoritie of the inquisitors, the learning, cunning, consent, and
estimation of writers herein, the false translations and fond interpre-
tations-used, speciallie by papists ; and manie other like causes. All
which toies take such hold upon mens fansies, as whereby they are
lead and entised awaie from the consideration of true respects, to the
condemnation of that which they know not.

Howbeit, I will (by Gods grace) in this my booke, so apparentlie
decipher and confute these cavils, and all other their objections ; as
everie witchmoonger shall be abashed, and all good men thereby
satisfied. In the meane time, I would wish them to know that if
neither the estimation of Gods omnipotencie, nor the tenor of his
word, nor the doubtfulnes or rather the impossibilitie of the case, nor
the small proofes brought against them, nor the rigor executed upon
them, nor the pitie that should be in a christian heart, nor yet their
simplicitie, impotencie, or age may suffice to suppresse the rage or
rigor wherewith they are oppressed ; yet the consideration of their
sex or kind ought to moove some mitigatio of their punishment.
For if nature (as Plinie reporteth) have taught a lion not to deale so
roughlie with a woman as with a man, bicause she is in bodie the

weaker vessell, and in hart more inclined to pitie (which Jeremie in Lam. jer. 3.
his lamentations seemeth to confirme) what should a man doo in this ^ct^^^io

more excellent creature, but bicause a woman is the weaker vessell.

And therefore among all modest and honest persons it is thought a

shame to offer violence or injurie to a woman : in which respect Vir. Georg.

Virgil saith, Nitlluni meniorabile nomen faviinea m pcrna est. IB. iv.]

God that knoweth my heart is witnes, and you that read my booke
shall see, that my drift and purpose in this enterprise tendeth onelie
to these respects. First, that the glorie and power of God be not so
abridged and abased, as to be thrust into the hand or lip of a lewd
old woman: whereby the worke of the Creator should be attributed to
the power of a creature. Secondlie, that the religion of the gospell
may be seene to stand without such peevish trumperie. Thirdlie,
that lawfull favour and christian compassion be rather used towards
these poore soules, than rigor and extremitie. Bicause they, which
are commonlie accused of witchcraft, are the least sufficient of all B 2 v
other persons to speake for themselves ; as having the most base and
simple education of all others ; the extremitie of their age giving
them leave to dote, their povertie to beg, their wrongs to chide and
threaten (as being void of anie other waie of revenge) their humor
melancholicall to be full of imaginations, from whence cheefelie pro-
ceedeth the vanitie of their confessions ; as that they can transforme
themselves and others into apes, owles, asses, dogs, cats, &c : that
they can flie in the aire, kill children with charmes, hinder the
comming of butter, &c.

And for so much as the mightie helpe themselves together, and the
poore widowes crie, though it reach to heaven, is scarse heard here Ecd[us.] 35,15.
upon earth : I thought good (according to my poore abilitie) to make
intercession, that some part of common rigor, and some points of
hastie judgement may be advised upon. For the world is now at that
stay (as Brentius in a most godlie sermon in these words afifirmeth)
that even as when the heathen persecuted the christians, if anie were
accused to beleeve in Christ, the common people cried Ad leonem: so
now, if anie woman, be she never so honest, be accused of witchcraft,
they crie Ad igneni. What difference is betweene the rash dealing of
unskilfull people, and the grave counsell of more discreet and learned
persons, may appeare by a tale of Daneeus his owne telling ; wherein
he opposeth the rashnes of a few townesmen, to the counsell of a
whole senate, preferring the follie of the one, before the wisdome of
the other.

The Epistle.



Lib. 15. cap.
1 8. de varie-
tatib. rerunt



At Orleance on Loyre (saith he) there was a manwitch, not only
IB. iv. -'.] taken and accused, but also convicted and condemned for witchcraft,
who appealed from thence to the high court of Paris. Which accusa-
tion the senate sawe insufficient, and would not allow, but laughed
thereat, lightlie regarding it ; and in the end sent him home (saith
he) as accused of a frivolous matter. And yet for all that, the magis-
trats of Orleance were so bold with him, as to hang him up within
short time after, for the same or the verie like offense. In which
example is to be scene the nature, and as it were the disease of this
cause : wherein (I saie) the simpler and undiscreeter sort are alwaies
more hastie & furious in judgements, than men of better reputation
and knowledge. Nevertheles, Eunichius saith, that these three things ;
to wit, what is to be thought of witches, what their incantations can
doo, and whether their punishment should extend to death, are to be
well considered. And I would (saith he) they were as well knowne,
as they are rashlie beleeved, both of the learned, and unlearned.
And further he saith, that almost all divines, physicians and lawyers,
who should best know these matters, satisfieng themselves with old
custome, have given too much credit to these fables, and too rash and
unjust sentence of death upon witches. But when a man pondereth
(saith he) that in times past, all that swarved from the church of
Rome were judged heretikes ; it is the lesse marvell, though in this
matter they be blind and ignorant.

And surelie, if the scripture had beene longer suppressed, more
absurd fables would have sproong up, and beene beleeved. Which
credulitie though it is to be derided with laughter; yet this their cruel-
B 3 tie is to be lamented with teares. For (God knoweth) manie of these
poore wretches had more need to be releeved than chastised ; and
more meete were a preacher to admonish them, than a gailor to keepe
them ; and a physician more necessarie to helpe them, than an
executioner or tormentor to hang or burne them. For proofe and
due triall hereof, I will requite Danasus his tale of a manwitch (as he
termeth him) with another witch of the same sex or gender.

Cardanus from the mouth of his owne father reporteth, that one
Barnard, a poore servant, being in wit verie simple and rude, but in
his service verie necessarie and diligent (and in that respect deerelie
\B. v.] beloved of his maister) professing the art of witchcraft, could in no
wise be dissuaded from that profession, persuading himselfe that he
knew all things, and could bring anie matter to passe ; bicause cer-
teine countrie people resorted to him for helpe and counsell, as
supposing by his owne talke, that he could doo somewhat. At length
he was condemned to be burned : which torment he seemed more
willing to suffer, than to loose his estimation in that behalfe. But his



The Epistle. xxv

maister having compassion upon him, and being himselfe in his
princes favor, perceiving his conceipt to proceed of melancholic,
obteined respit of execution for twentie daies. In which time (saith
he) his maister bountifullie fed him with good fat meat, and with foure
egs at a meale, as also with sweet wine : which diet was best for so
grosse and weake a bodie. And being recovered so in strength, that
the humor was suppressed, he was easilie woone from his absurd and
dangerous opinions, and from all his fond imaginations : and con-
fessing his error and follie, from the which before no man could
remoove him by anie persuasions, having his pardon, he lived long a
good member of the church, whome otherwise the crueltie of judge-
ment should have cast awaie and destroied.

This historie is more credible than Sprengers fables, or Bodins
babies, which reach not so far to the extolling of witches omnipotencie,
as to the derogating of Gods glorie. For if it be true, which they
affirme, that our life and death lieth in the hand of a witch ; then is
it false, that God maketh us live or die, or that by him we have our
being, our terme of life appointed, and our daies numbred. But surelie
their charmes can no more reach to the hurting or killing of men or
women, than their imaginations can extend to the stealing and car-
rieng awaie of horsses & mares. Neither hath God given remedies
to sicknes or greefes, by words or charmes, but by hearbs and
medicines ; which he himselfe hath created upon earth, and given Amos. 3. 6.
men knowledge of the same; that he might be glorified, for that La.jer. 3. 38.

o j3 J Isai, 45. 9.

therewith he dooth vouchsafe that the maladies of men and cattell Rom. 9. 20.

should be cured, &c. And if there be no affliction nor calamitie, but

is brought to passe by him, then let us defie the divell, renounce

all his works, and not so much as once thinke or dreame upon this

supernaturall power of witches ; neither let us prosecute them with

such despight, whome our fansie condemneth,and our reason acquiteth :

our evidence against them consisting in impossibilities, our proofes [5 v. v.'\

in unwritten verities, and our whole proceedings in doubts and

difficulties.

Now bicause I mislike the extreame crueltie used against some of b 3. v.
these sillie soules (whome a simple advocate having audience and
justice might deliver out of the hands of the inquisitors themselves)
it will be said, that I denie anie punishment at all to be due to anie
witch whatsoever. Naie, bicause I bewraie the follie and impietie of
them, which attribute unto witches the power of God : these witch-
moongers will report, that I denie there are anie witches at all : and
yet behold (saie they) how often is this word [Witch]* mentioned in the * [ ] in text,
scriptures ? Even as if an idolater should saie in the behalfe of
images and idols, to them which denie their power and godhead, and

d



xxvi The Epistle.

inveigh against the reverence doone unto them ; How dare you denie
the power of- images, seeing their names are so often repeated in the
scriptures ? But truehe I denie not that there are witches or images :
but I detest the idolatrous opinions conceived of them ; referring that
to Gods worke and ordinance, which they impute to the power and
malice of witches ; and attributing that honour to God, which they
ascribe to idols. But as for those that in verie deed are either
witches or conjurors, let them hardlie suffer such punishment as to
their fault is agreeable, and as by the grave judgement of lawe is
provided.

THE END.




The discoverie of Witchcraft.
^f The first Booke.

The first Chapter.

An impeachment of Witches power in jneteors and elementarie bodies
tciidiiii!; to the rebicke of such as attribute too much unto them.

I HE fables of Witchcraft have taken so fast hold and deepe
root in the heart of man, that fewe or none can (novva-
daies) with patience indure the hand and correction of
God. For if any adversitie, greefe, sicknesse, losse of
children, corne, cattell, or libertie happen vnto them ; by & by
they exclaime uppon witches. As though there were no God in
Israel that ordereth all things according to his will ; punishing both
just and unjust with greefs, plagues, and afflictions in maner and
forme as he thinketh good : but that certeine old women heere on
earth, called witches, must needs be the contrivers of all mens
calamities, and as though they themselves were innocents, and had
deserved no such punishments. Insomuch as they sticke not to ride
and go to such, as either are injuriouslie tearmed witches, or else are
willing 50 to be accounted, seeking at their hands comfort and remedie
in time of their tribulation, contrarie to Gods will and commandement
in that behalfe, who bids us resort to him in all  our necessities.

Such faithlesse people (I saie) are also persuaded, that neither
haile nor snowe, thunder nor lightening, raine nor tempestuous winds
come from the heavens at the commandement of God : but are raised
by the cunning and power of witches and conjurers ; insomuch as a
clap of thunder, or a gale of wind is no sooner heard, but either they
run to ring bels, or crie out to burne witches ; or else burne consecrated
things, hoping by the smoke thereof, to drive the divell out of the
aire, as though spirits could be fraied awaie with such externall toies :
howbeit, these are right inchantments, as Brentius affirmeth.

But certeinlie, it is neither a witch, nor divell, but a glorious^ God
that maketh the thunder. I have read in the scriptures, that God ^
maketh the blustering tempests and whirlewinds : and I find that it
is<= the Lord that altogither dealeth with them, and that they*^ blowe
according to his will. But let me see anie of them all " rebuke and
still the sea in time of tempest, as Christ did ; or raise the stormie
wind, as ^ God did with his word ; and I will beleeve in them. Hath

anie witch or conjurer, or anie creature entred into the ^ treasures of
the snowe ; or seene the secret places of the haile, which GOD hath
prepared against the daie of trouble, battell, and warre? I for my part
also thinkewith Jesus Sirach, that at Gods onelie commandement the
snowe falleth ; and that the wind bloweth according to his will, who
onelie maketh all stormes to cease; a.nd.'^ who (if we keepe his
ordinances) will send us raine in due season, and make the land to
bring forth hir increase, and the trees of the field to give their fruit.

But little thinke our witchmongers, that the ^ Lord commandeth the
clouds above, or openeth the doores of heaven, as David aftirmeth ;
or that the Lord goeth forth in the tempests and stormes, as the
Prophet '^ Nalunn reporteth: but rather that witches and conjurers are
then about their businesse.

The Martionists acknowledged one God the authour of good things,
and another the ordeiner of evill : but these make the divell a whole
o-od, to create things of nothing, to knowe mens cogitations, and to
doo that which God never did ; as, to transubstantiate men into beasts,
&c. Which thing if divels could doo,  yet followeth it not, that
witches have such power. But if all the divels in hell were dead,
and all the witches in England burnt or hanged ; I warrant you we
should not faile to have raine, haile and tempests, as now we have :
according to the appointment and will of God, and according to the
constitution of the elements, and the course of the planets, wherein
God hath set a perfect and perpetuall order.

I am also well assured, that if all the old women in the world were
witches ; and all the priests, conjurers : we should not have a drop
of raine, nor a blast of wind the more or the lesse for them. For Uhe
Lord hath bound the waters in the clouds, and hath set bounds
about the waters, untill the daie and night come to an end : yea it is
God that raiseth the winds and stilleth them : and he saith to the
rame and snowe ; Be upon the earth, and it falleth. The ™ wind of the
Lord, and not the wind of witches, shall destroie the treasures of
their plesant vessels, and drie up the fountaines ; saith Oseas. Let
us also learne and confesse with the Prophet Z'aw^, that we ° our
selves are the causes of our afflictions ; and not exclaime upon
witches, when we should call upon God for mercie.

The Imperiall lawe (saith Brentius) condemneth them to death
that trouble and infect the aire : but I aflirme (saith he) that it is
neither in the power of witch not divell so to doo, but in God onelie.
Though (besides Bodin, and all the popish writers in generall) it
please Danceus, Hyperiiis, Haningius, Erasius, &c. to conclude
otherwise. The clouds" are called the pillers of Gods tents, Gods
chariots, and his pavillions. And if it be so, what witch or divell can

ment of the angels that fell, but are obedient to the onelie God.

tUT the world is now so bewitched and over-run with this
fond error, that even where a man shuld seeke comfort

from God to the divell ; and from the Physician, to the
coosening witch, who will not sticke to take upon hir, by wordes
to heale the lame (which was proper onelie to Christ ; and to
them whom he assisted with his divine power) yea, with hir
familiar & charmes she will take upon hir to cure the blind : though

had in their parish at one instant, xvii. or xviii. witches : meaning
such as could worke miracles supernaturallie. Whereby they
manifested as well their infidelitie and ignorance, in conceiving Gods
word ; as their negligence and error in instructing their flocks. For
they themselves might understand, and also teach their parishoners,
that ^ God onelie worketh great woonders ; and that it is he which ''Psai. 72, & 136.

and impietie.
Margaret*Siraons, ^"^ the assiscs hoMcn at Rochester, Anno 1581, one Margaret
a supposed witch. Szmo7is,l the wife ofjohfi Siino7is, of Brenchlie in Kent, was araigned
for witchcraft, at the instigation and complaint of divers fond and
malicious persons ; and speciallie by the meanes of or\& JoJui Ferrall
vicar of that parish : with whom I talked about that matter, and
found him both fondlie assotted in the cause, and enviouslie bent
towards hir : and (which is worse) as unable to make a good account
of his faith, as shee whom he accused. That which he, for his part,
laid to the poore womans charge, was this.

His Sonne (being an ungratious boie, and prentise to one Robert
Scotcliford clothier, dwelling in that parish of Brenchlie') passed on a
dale by hir house ; at whome by chance hir little dog barked. Which
thing the boie taking in evill part, drewe his knife, & pursued him
therewith even to hir doore : whom she rebuked with some such
words as the boie disdained, & yet neverthelesse would not be per-
suaded to depart in a long time. At the last he returned to his
maisters house, and within five or sixe daies fell sicke. Then was
called to mind the fraie betwixt the dog and the boie : insomuch as
the vicar (who thought himselfe so privileged, as he little mistrusted
that God would visit his children with sicknes) did so calculate ; as
he found, partlie through his owne judgement, and partlie (as he him-
6. selfe told me) by the relation of other witches, that his said sonne was
by hir bewitched. Yea, he also told me, that this his sonne (being as
it were past all cure) received perfect health at the hands of another
witch.

He proceeded yet further against hir, affirming, that alwaies in his
parish church,when he desired to read most plainelie, his voice so failed
him, as he could scant be heard at all. Which hee could impute, he
said, to nothing else, but to hir inchantment. When I advertised the
poore woman hereof, as being desirous to heare what she could saie
for hir selfe ; she told me, that in verie deed his voice did much faile

him, speciallie when he strained himselfe to speake lowdest. How
beit, she said that at all times his voice was hoarse and lowe : which
thing I perceived to be true. But sir, said she, you shall understand,
that this our vicar is diseased with such a kind of hoarsenesse, as
divers of our neighbors in this parish, not long since, doubted that he
had the French pox ; & in that respect utterly refused to communi-
cate with him: untill such time as (being therunto injoined by
M, D. Lewen the Ordinarie) he had brought fro London a certificat,
under the hands of two physicians, that his hoarsenes proceeded from
a disease in the lungs. Which certificat he published in the church,
in the presence of the whole congregation : and by this meanes hee
was cured, or rather excused of the shame of his disease. And this I
knowe to be true by the relation of divers honest men of that parish.
And truelie, if one of the Jurie had not beene wiser than the other, she
had beene condemned thereupon, and upon other as ridiculous matters
as this. For the name of a witch is so odious, and hir power so
feared among the common people, that if the honestest bodie living
chance to be arraigned therupon, she shall hardlie escape condem-
nation.

The third Chapter.

Who they be that are called witches, with a manifest declaratioft of
the cause that tnooveth men so commonlie to thijike^ and witches
themselves to beleeve that they can htirt children, cattell, S^c. with
words and imaginatiofts : and of coosening witches.

[;NE sort of such as are said to bee witches, are women
which be commonly old, lame, bleare-eied, pale, fowle,
and full of wrinkles ; poore, sullen, superstitious, and
papists ; or such as knowe no religion : in whose
drousie minds the divell hath goten a fine seat ; so as, what
mischeefe, mischance, calamitie, or slaughter is brought to passe,
they are easilie persuaded the same is doone by themselves ;
inprinting in their minds an earnest and constant imagination Cardan, devar.
hereof. They are leane and deformed, shewing melancholie in their
faces, to the horror of all that see them. They are doting, scolds,
mad, divelish ; and not much differing from them that are thought to
be possessed with spirits ; so firme and stedfast in their opinions, as
whosoever shall onelie have respect to the constancie of their words
uttered, would easilie beleeve they were true indeed.

These miserable wretches are so odious unto all their neighbors,
and so feared, as few dare offend them, or denie them anie thing they
aske : whereby they take upon them ; yea, and sometimes thinke,
that they can doo such things as are beyond the abilitie of humane

nature. These go from house to house, and from doore to doore for a
pot full of milke, yest, drinke, pottage, or some such releefe ; without
the which they could hardlie live : neither obtaining for their service
and paines, nor by their art, nor yet at the divels hands (with whome
they are said to make a perfect and visible bargaine) either beautie,
monie, promotion, welth, worship, pleasure, honor, knowledge,
S. learning, or anie other benefit whatsoever. 

It falleth out many times, that neither their necessities, nor their
expectation is answered or served, in those places where they beg or
borrowe ; but rather their lewdnesse is by their neighbors reprooved.
And further, in tract of time the witch waxeth odious and tedious to
hir neighbors ; and they againe are despised and despited of hir : so
as sometimes she cursseth one, and sometimes another ; and that
from the maister of the house, his wife, children, cattell, &c. to the
little pig that lieth in the stie. Thus in processe of time they have all
displeased hir, and she hath wished evill lucke unto them all ; perhaps
with cursses and imprecations made in forme. Doubtlesse (at length)
some of hir neighbors die, or fall sicke ; or some of their children are
visited with diseases that vex them strangelie : as apoplexies,
epilepsies, convulsions, hot fevers, wormes, &c. Which by ignorant
parents are supposed to be the vengeance of witches. Yea and their
opinions and conceits are confirmed and maintained by unskilfull
physicians : according to the common saieng ; Inscitice pallium
malejiciuni &r^ iticantatio, Witchcraft and inchantment is the cloke
of ignorance : whereas indeed evill humors, & not strange words,
witches, or spirits are the causes of such diseases. Also some of their
cattell perish, either by disease or mischance. Then they, upon whom
such adversities fall, weighing the fame that goeth upon this woman
(hir words, displeasure, and cursses meeting so justlie with their mis-
fortune) doo not onelie conceive, but also are resolved, that all their
mishaps are brought to passe by hir onelie meanes.

The witch on the other side exspecting hir neighbours mischances,

and seeing things sometimes come to passe according to hir wishes,

Bodjn li.2.de cursses, and incantations (for Boditi himselfe confesseth, that not

being called before a Justice, by due examination of the circumstances

is driven to see hir imprecations and desires, and hir neighbors

harmes and losses to concurre, and as it were to take effect : and so

confesseth that she (as a goddes) hath brought such things to passe.

Wherein, not onelie she, but the accuser, and also the Justice are

fowhe deceived and abused ; as being thorough hir confession and

other circumstances persuaded (to the injurie of Gods glorie) that she

Another sort of witches there are, which be absolutehe cooseners.
These take upon them, either for gloria, fame, or gaine, to doo anie

the divels will, contrarie to the witches oth, promise, and
homage, and contrarie to all reason, that witches should

helpe anie thing that is bewitched ; but rather set forward

of three sorts of witches ; and the same is affirmed by all the writers
heereupon, new and old. One sort (they say) can hurt and not
helpe, the second can helpe and not hurt, the third can both helpe
and hurt. And among the hurtfull witches he saith there is one
sort more beastlie than any kind of beasts, saving woolves : for these
usuallie devoure and eate yong children and infants of their owne
kind. These be they (saith he) that raise haile, tempests, and hurtfull
weather ; as lightening, thunder, &c. These be they that procure
barrennesse in man, woman, and beast. These can throwe children
into waters, as they walke with their mothers, and  not be scene. 7-
These can make horsses kicke, till they cast the riders. These can
passe from place to place in the aire invisible. These can so alter
the mind of judges, that they can have no power to hurt them. These
can procure to themselves and to others, taciturnitie and insensibilitie
in their torments. These can bring trembling to the hands, and
strike terror into the minds of them that apprehend them. These can
manifest unto others, things hidden and lost, and foreshew things 10.
to come ; and see them as though they were present. These can
alter mens minds to inordinate love or hate. These can kill whom
they list with lightening and thunder. These can take awaie mans
courage, and the power of generation. These can make a woman
miscarrie in childbirth, and destroie the child in the mothers wombe,
without any sensible meanes either inwardhe or outwardlie applied.
These can with their looks kill either man or beast.

All these things are avowed by James Spre7tger and Henrie Institor
III malleo malejicarum, to be true, & confirmed by Nider, and the
inquisitor Cumanus ; and also by Danceus, Hyperius, Hemingius, and
multiplied by Bodinus, and frier Bartholomccus Spineus. But bicause

Som saie they can transubstantiate themselves and others, and take
the forms and shapes of asses, woolves, ferrets, cowes, apes, horsses,

of todes and cats.

They can raise spirits (as others affirme) drie up springs, turne the
course of running waters, inhibit the sunne, and staie both day and
night, changing the one into the other. They can go in and out
at awger holes, & saile in an egge shell, a cockle or muscle shell,
through and under the tempestuous seas. They can go invisible,
and deprive men of their privities, and otherwise of the act and
use of venerie. They can bring soules out of the graves. They
can teare snakes in peeces with words, and with looks kill
lambes. But in this case a man may saie, that Miranda cafinnt j

The fift Chapter.

A confutation of the common coticeived opinion of witches and
witchcraft, and how detestable a sinne it is to repaire to them for
cotinsell or helpe in time of affliction.

UT whatsoever is reported or conceived of such maner of
witchcrafts, I dare avow to be false and fabulous (coosin-
age, dotage, and poisoning excepted :) neither is there
any mention made of these kind of witches in the Bible.
If Christ had knowne them, he would not have pretermitted to
invaie against their presumption, in taking upon them his office :
as, to heale and cure diseases ; and to worke such miraculous and
supernaturall things, as whereby he himselfe was speciallie knowne,
beleeved, and published to be God ; his actions and cures consist-
ing (in order and effect) according to the power by our witch-
moongers imputed to witches. Howbeit, if there be any in these
daies afflicted in such strange sort, as Christs cures and patients
are described in the new testament to have beene : we flie from
trusting in God to trusting in witches, who doo not onelie in their
coosening art take on them the office of Christ in this behalfe ; but
use his verie phrase of speech to such idolaters, as com to seeke
divine  assistance at their hands, saieng ; Go thy waies, thy sonne or j^.
thy daughter, &c. shall doo well, and be whole. John, s : 6.

It will not suffice to dissuade a witchmonger from his credulitie, that ^"^^ ^' '^'''
he seeth the sequele and event to fall out manie times contrarie to their
assertion ; but in such case (to his greater condemnation) he seeketh
further to witches of greater fame. If all faile, he will rather thinke
he came an houre too late ; than that he went a mile too far. Trulie
I for my part cannot perceive what is to go a whoring after strange to go to witches,
gods, if this be not. He that looketh upon his neighbors wife, and &c. is idolatrie.
lusteth after hir, hath committed adulterie. And truelie, he that in
hart and by argument mainteineth the sacrifice of the masse to be
propitiatorie for the quicke and the dead, is an idolater ; as also he
that alloweth and commendeth creeping to the crosse, and such like
idolatrous actions, although he bend not his corporall knees.

In like manner I say, he that attributeth to a witch, such divine
power, as dulie and onelie apperteineth unto GOD (which all witch-
mongers doo) is in hart a blasphemer, an idolater, and full of grosse
impietie, although he neither go nor send to hir for assistance.

The sixt Chapter.

A ftirther conftitation of 'witches miraculous and ovmipotent
power,, by invincible reasons and authorities, with dissuasions
frojn such fond credulitie.

I'F witches could doo anie such miraculous things, as these
and other which are imputed to them, they might doo
them againe and againe, at anie time or place, or at
anie mans desire : for the divell is as strong at one
time as at another, as busie by daie as by night, and readie enough
to doo all mischeefe, and careth not whom he abuseth. And
in so much as it is confessed, by the most part of witchmoongers
themselves, that he knoweth not the cogitation of mans heart, he
should (me thinks) sometimes appeere  unto honest and credible
persons, in such grosse and corporall forme, as it is said he dooth
unto witches : which you shall never heare to be justified by one
sufficient witnesse. For the divell indeed entreth into the mind, and
that waie seeketh mans confusion.

The art alwaies presupposeth the power ; so as, if they saie they
can doo this or that, they must shew how and by what meanes they
doo it; as neither the witches, nor the witchmoongers are able to doo.
For to everie action is required the facultie and abilitie of the agent or
dooer; the aptnes of the patient or subject; and a convenient and
possible apphcation. Now the witches are mortall, and their power
dependeth upon the analogie and consonancie of their minds and
bodies ; but with their minds they can but will and understand ; and
with their bodies they can doo no more, but as the bounds and ends
of terrene sense will suffer : and therefore their power extendeth not
to doo such miracles, as surmounteth their owne sense, and the
understanding of others which are wiser than they ; so as here
wanteth the vertue and power of the efficient. And in reason, there
can be no more vertue in the thing caused, than in the cause, or that
which proceedeth of or from the benefit of the cause. And we see,
that ignorant and impotent women, or witches, are the causes of
incantations and charmes ; wherein we shall perceive there is none
effect, if we will credit our owne experience and sense unabused, the
rules of philosophic, or the word of God. For alas! What an unapt
instrument is a toothles, old, impotent, and unweldie woman to flie in
the aier ? Truelie, the divell little needs such instruments to bring his
purposes to passe.

It is strange, that we should suppose, that such persons can worke
such feates: and it is more strange, that we will imagine that to be

possible to be doone by a witch, which to nature and sense is impos-
sible ; speciallie when our neighbours life dependeth upon our
credulitie therein ; and when we may see the defect of abilitie, which
alwaies is an impediment both to the act, and also to the presumption
thereof. And bicause there is nothing possible in lawe, that in nature
is impossible ; therefore the judge dooth not attend or regard what
the accused man saith ; or yet would doo : but what is prooved to
have beene committed, and naturallie falleth in mans power and 14.
will to doo. For the lawe saith, that To will a thing unpossible, is a
signe of a mad man, or of a foole, upon whom no sentence or judge-
ment taketh hold. Fui'thermore, what Jurie will condemne, or what
Judge will give sentence or judgement against one for killing a man
at Berxvicke ; when they themselves, and manie other sawe that man
at London^ that verie dale, wherein the murther was committed ; yea
though the partie confesse himself guiltie therein, and twentie wit-
nesses depose the same ? But in this case also I saie the judge is not
to weigh their testimonie, which is weakened by lawe ; and the judges
authoritie is to supplie the imperfection of the case, and to mainteine
the right and equitie of the same.

Seeing therefore that some other things might naturallie be the
occasion and cause of such calamities as witches are supposed to
bring ; let not us that professe the Gospell and knowledge of Christ,
be bewitched to beleeve that they doo such things, as are in nature im-
possible, and in sense and reason incredible. If they saie it is doone
through the divels helpe, who can work miracles ; whie doo not theeves
bring their busines to passe miraculouslie, with whom the divell is as
conversant as with the other? Such mischeefes as are imputed to
witches, happen where no witches are ; yea and continue when witches
are hanged and burnt : whie then should we attribute such effect to that
cause, which being taken awaie, happeneth neverthelesse ?

one point, and some is coosened in another, untill in fine, all these
impossibihties, and manie mo, are by severall persons affirmed to be
true.

And this I have also noted, that when anie one is coosened with a
coosening toie of witchcraft, and maketh report thereof accordinglie
verifieng a matter most impossible and false as it were upon his owne
knowledge, as being overtaken with some kind of illusion or other
(which illusions are right inchantments) even the selfe-same man will
deride the  like lie proceeding out of another mans mouth, as a
fabulous matter unworthie of credit. It is also to be woondered, how
men (that have seene some part of witches coosenages detected, and
see also therein the impossibilitie of their owne presumptions, &
the follie and falsehood of the witches confessions) will not suspect,
but remaine unsatisfied, or rather obstinatelie defend the residue of
witches supernaturall actions : like as when a juggler hath discovered
the slight and illusion of his principall feats, one would fondlie continue
to thinke, that his other petie juggling knacks of legierdemaine are
done by the helpe of a familiar : and according to the follie of some
papists, who seeing and confessing the popes absurd religion, in the
erection and maintenance of idolatrie and superstition, speciallie in
images, pardons, and relikes of saints, will yet persevere to thinke,
that the rest of his doctrine and trumperie is holie and good.

Finallie, manie mainteine and crie out for the execution of witches,*
that particularlie beleeve never a whit of that which is imputed unto
them ; if they be therein privatelie dealt withall, and substantiallie
j6. opposed and tried in argument.

The eight Chapter.

Causes that moove as well witches themselves as others to thinke that
they can worke impossibilities, with answers to certeine objec-
tio7is : where also their ptmishment by lawe is touched.

\ARDANUS writeth, that the cause of such credulitie
consisteth in three points ; to wit, in the imagina-
tion of the melancholike, in the constancie of them
that are corrupt therewith, and in the deceipt of the
Judges ; who being inquisitors themselves against heretikes and
witches, did both accuse and condemne them, having for their
labour the spoile of their goods. So as these inquisitors added

manie fables hereunto, least they should seeme to have doone
injurie to the poore wretches, in condemning and executing them for
none offense. But sithens (saith he) the springing up of Luthers sect,
these priests have tended more diligentlie upon the execution of them ;
bicause more wealth is to be caught from them : insomuch as now
they deale so looselie with witches (through distrust of gaines) that
all is seene to be malice, foUie, or avarice that hath beene practised
against them. And whosoever shall search into this cause, or read
the cheefe writers hereupon, shall find his words true.

It will be objected, that we here in England are not now directed An objection
by the popes lawes ; and so by consequence our witches not troubled
or convented by the inquisitors Ha:reticce pravitatis. I answer, that
in times past here in England, as in other nations, this order of
discipline hath beene in force and use ; although now some part of
old rigor be qualified by two severall statutes made in the fift of
Elizabeth, and xxxiii of Henrie the eight. Nevertheles the estimation
of the omnipotencie of their words and charmes seemeth in those
statutes to be somewhat mainteined, as a matter hitherto generallie
received ; and not yet so looked into, as  that it is refuted and decided. 12.
But how wiselie so ever the Parlement house hath dealt therin, or 77.
how mercifullie soever the prince beholdeth the cause : if a poore
old woman, supposed to be a witch, be by the civill or canon lawe
convented ; I doubt, some canon will be found in force, not onelie to
give scope to the tormentor, but also to the hangman, to exercise their
offices upon hir. And most certaine it is, that in what point soever
anie of these extremities, which I shall rehearse unto you, be mitigated,
it is thorough the goodnesse of the Queenes Majestic, and hir excellent
magistrates placed among us. For as touching the opinion of our
writers therein in our age ; yea in our owne countrie, you shall see
it doth not onlie agree with forren crueltie, but surmounteth it farre.
If you read a foolish pamphlet dedicated to the lord Darcy by W. W booke.'prin-
1582. you shall see that he affirmeth, that all those tortures are farre Do^^f'j"^""
too light, and their rigor too mild ; and that in that respect he
impudentlie exclameth against our magistrates, who suffer them to be
but hanged, when murtherers, & such malefactors be so used, which
deserve not the hundreth part of their punishments. But if you will
see more foUie and lewdnes comprised in one lewd booke, I com-
mend you to Ri. Ga. a Windsor man ; who being a mad man hath
written according to his frantike humor : the reading wherof may
satisfie a wise man, how mad all these witchmoongers dealings be in

A conclusion of the first booke, wherein is fore-shewed the tyrannicall

tyrannic, what grosse and fond absurdities, what un-
naturall & uncivil discourtisie, what cancred and spiteful!

The first Chapter.

What testimonies ajtd witiiesses are allowed to give evidence against
repJited luitches, by the report Sr* allowance of the inquisitors
themselves, aJid such as are speciall writers heerein.

XCOMMUNICAT persons, partakers of the fait, infants,
wicked servants, and runnawaies are to be admitted to
beare witnesse against their dames in this mater of
witchcraft : bicause (saith Bodin the champion of witch-
moongers) none that be honest are able to detect them. Here-
ikes also and witches shall be received to accuse, but not to
excuse a witch. And finallie, the testimonie of all infamous per-
sons in this case is good and allowed. Yea, one lewd person (saith
Bodin) may be received to accuse and condemne a thousand suspected
witches. And although by lawe, a capitall enimie may be challenged ;
yet James Sprenger, and Henrie Institor, (from whom Bodin, and all
the writers that ever I have read, doo receive their light, authorities
and arguments) saie (upon this point of lawe) that The poore frend-
lesse old woman must proove, that hir capitall enimie would have
illed hir, and that hee hath both assalted & wounded hir ; otherwise
she pleadeth all in vaine. If the judge aske hir, whether she have
anie capitall enimies ; and she rehearse other, and forget hir accuser 5
or else answer that he was hir capitall enimie, but now she hopeth he
is not so : such a one is nevertheles admitted for a witnes. And
though by lawe, single witnesses are not admittable ; yet if one depose
she hath bewitched hir cow ; another, hir sow ; and the third, hir
butter : these saith (saith M. Mai. a.nd Bodin) are no single witnesses ;
bicause they agree that she is a witch.

The second Chapter.

The order of examination of witches by the inquistors.

OMEN suspected to be witches, after their apprehension

may not be suffered to go home, or to other places, to

seek suerties : for then (saith Bodin) the people would

be woorse willing to accuse them ; for feare least

returne home, they worke revenge upon them. In which

Bodin commendeth much the Scottish custome and order

or a chest is placed in the church, into the which any bodie may
freelie cast a little scroll of paper, wherein may be conteined the
name of the witch, the time, place, and fact, &c. And the same chest
being locked with  three severall locks, is opened everie fifteenth daie
by three inquisitors or officers appointed for that purpose ; which
keepe three severall kaies. And thus the accuser need not be
knowne, nor shamed with the reproch of slander or malice to his
poore neighbour.

Item, there must be great persuasions used to all men, women, and
children, to accuse old women of witchcraft.

Item, there may alwaies be promised impunitie and favour to
witches, that confesse and detect others ; and for the contrarie, there
may be threatnings and violence practised and used.

Item, the little children of witches, which will not confesse, must be
attached ; who (if they be craftilie handled saith Bodin) will confesse
against their owne mothers.

Item, witches must be examined as suddenlie, and as unawares as

is possible : the which will so amaze them, that they will confesse

any thing, supposing the divell hath forsaken them ; wheras if they

21. should first be comitted to prison, the divell would temper with them,

and informe them what to doo.

Item, the inquisitor, judge, or examiner, must begin with small
matters first.

Item, they must be examined, whether their parents were witches
or no : for witches (as these Doctors suppose) come by propagation.
. Bod. lib. dt And Bodm setteth downe this principle in witchcraft, to wit, Si saga
L.^arenltes"' '^' sit mater, sic etiam estfilia: howbeit the la we forbiddeth it, Ob san-
guinis reverentiam.

Item, the examiner must looke stedfastlie upon their eies : for they
cannot looke directlie upon a mans face (as Bodin affirmeth in one
place, although in another he saith, that they kill and destrcie both
men and beasts with their lookes.)

Item, she must be examined of all accusations, presumptions, and
faults, at one instant ; least sathan should afterwards dissuade hir
from confession.

Item, a witch may not be put in prison alone, least the divell dis-
suade hir from confession, through promises of her indemnitie. For
(saith Bodin) some that have beene in the gaole have prooved to flie
awaie, as they were woont to doo when they met with Diana and
Minerva, Gr>c. : and so brake their owne necks against the stone
walles.

Item, if anie denie hir owne confession made without torture, she

is neverthelesse by that confession to be condemned, as in anie other
crime.

Item, the judges must seeme to put on a pittifull countenance and
to mone them ; saieng, that It was not they, but the divell that com-
mitted the murther, and that he compelled them to doo it ; and must
make them beleeve that they thinke them to be innocents.

Item, if they will confesse nothing but upon the racke or torture ;
their apparell must be changed, and everie haire in their bodie must
be shaven off with a sharpe razor.

Item, if they have charmes for taciturnitie, so as they feele not
the common tortures, and therefore confesse nothing : then some
sharpe instrument must be thrust betwixt everie naile of their fingers
and toes : which (as  Bodin saith) was king Childeberts devise, and is k. chiideberts
to this daie of all others the most effectuall. For by meanes of that ^^^eii devise.
extreme paine, they will (saith he) confesse anie  thing. 22.

Item, Pmilus Grillafidus, being an old dooer in these matters, p. GrUlandus.
wisheth that when witches sleepe, and feele no paine upon the
torture, Dojiiiiie labia mea aperies should be said, and so (saith he)
both the torments will be felt, and the truth will be uttered : Et sic ars
debiditur arte.

Item, Bodin saith, that at the time of examination, there should
be a semblance of great a doo, to the terrifieing of the witch : and
that a number of instruments, gieves, manacles, ropes, halters, fetters,
&c. be prepared, brought foorth, and laid before the examinate : and
also that some be procured to make a most horrible and lamentable
crie, in the place of torture, as though he or she were upon the racke,
or in the tormentors hands : so as the examinate may heare it whiles
she is examined, before she hir selfe be brought into the prison ; and
perhaps (saith he) she will by this meanes confesse the matter.

Item, there must be subborned some craftie spie, that may seeme
to be a prisoner with hir in the like case ; who perhaps may in con-
ference undermine hir, and so bewraie and discover hir.

Item, if she will not yet confesse, she must be told that she is detected,
and accused by other of hir companions ; although in truth there be
no such matter : and so perhaps she will confesse, the rather to be
revenged upon hir adversaries and accusers.

Matters of evidence against witches.

who dieth shortlie after ; or else is infected with the

leprosie, apoplexie, or anie other strange disease : it is

as condemnation or death must insue, without further proofe ;
if anie bodie have mistrusted hir, or said before that she was a
23. witch. 

Item, if anie come in, or depart out of the chamber or house, the
doores being shut ; it is an apparent and sufficient evidence to a
witches condemnation, without further triall : which thing Bodin
never sawe. If he can shew me that feat, I will subscribe to his
follie. For Christ after his resurrection used the same : not as a
ridiculous toie, that everie witch might accomplish ; but as a speciall
miracle, to strengthen the faith of the elect.

Item, if a woman bewitch anie bodies eies, she is to be executed
without further proofe.

Item, if anie inchant or bewitch mens beasts, or corne, or flie in the
aire, or make a dog speake, or cut off anie mans members, and unite
them againe to men or childi'ens bodies ; it is sufficient proofe to con-
demnation.

Item, presumptions and conjectures are sufficient proofes against
16. witches. 

Item, if three witnesses doo but saie, Such a woman is a witch ;
then is it a cleere case that she is to be executed with death. Which
matter Bodin saith is not onelie certeine by the canon and civill
lawes, but by the opinion of pope Innocent^ the wisest pope (as he
saith) that ever was.

Item, the complaint of anie one man of credit is sufficient to bring
a poore woman to the racke or pullie.

Item, a condemned or infamous persons testimonie is good and
allowable in matters of witchcraft.

Item, a witch is not to be delivered, though she endure all the
tortures, and confesse nothing ; as all other are in anie criminall
cases.

Item, though in other cases the depo.sitions of manie women at one
instant are disabled, as insufficient in lawe ; bicause of the imbecillitie
and frailtie of their nature or sex : yet in this matter, one woman,
though she be a partie, either accuser or accused, and be also
infamous and impudent (for such are Bodins words) yea and alreadie
condemned ; she may neverthelesse serve to accuse and condemne a
witch.

Item, a witnesse uncited, and offering himselfe in this case is to be
heard, and in none other.

Item, a capitall enimie (if the enimitie be pretended to growe by
24, meanes of witchcraft) may object against a witch ; and none  exception
is to be had or made against him.

The fourth Chapter.

Confessions of witches, whereby they are condemned.

|OME witches confesse (saith Bodin) that are desirous to
die ; not for glorie, but for despaire : bicause they are
tormented in their life time. But these may not be
spared (saith he) although the lawe dooth excuse them.

The best and surest confession is at shrift, to hir ghostlie father.

Item, if she confesse manie things that are false, and one thing that
may be true ; she is to be taken and executed upon that confession. 

Item, she is not so guiltie that confesseth a falshood or lie, and
denieth a truth ; as she that answereth by circumstance.

Item, an equivocall or doubtfull answer is taken for a confession
against a witch. 

Item, Bodin reporteth, that one confessed that he went out, or
rather up into the aire, and was transported manie miles to the fairies
danse, onelie bicause he would spie unto what place his wife went to
bagging, and how she behaved hir selfe. Whereupon was much a doo
among the inquisitors and lawyers, to discusse whether he should be
executed with his wife or no. But it was concluded that he must die,
bicause he bewraied not his wife : the which he forbare to doo,
Propter reverentiam honoris &^ families.

Item, if a woman confesse freelie herein, before question be made;
and yet afterward denie it : she is neverthelesse to be burned.

Item, they affirme that this extremitie is herein used, bicause not
one among a thousand witches is detected. And yet it is affirmed by
Sprefiger, in M. Mai. that there is not so little a parish, but there are
manie witches knowne to be therein.

Presicnptions, whereby witches are condemned.

I F anie womans child chance to die at hir hand, so as no
bodie knoweth how ; it may not be thought or presumed
that the mother killed it, except she be supposed a witch :
and in that case it is otherwise, for she must upon that
presumption be executed ; except she can proove the negative or
contrarie.

Item, if the child of a woman that is suspected to be a witch, be
lacking or gone from hir ; it is to be presumed, that she hath sacrificed
it to the divell : except she can proove the negati^ve or contrarie.

Item, though in other persons, certeine points of their confessions
may be thought erronious, and imputed to error : yet (in witches
causes) all oversights, imperfections, and escapes must  be adjudged
impious and malicious, and tend to hir confusion and condemnation.

Item, though a theefe be not said in lawe to be infamous in any
other matter than in theft ; yet a witch defamed of witchcraft is said
to be defiled with all maner of faults and infamies universallie,
though she were not condemned ; but (as I said) defamed with the
name of a witch. For rumors and reports are sufficient (saith Boditi)
to condemne a witch.

Item, if any man, woman, or child doo saie, that such a one is a
witch ; it is a most vehement suspicion (saith Bodin) and sufficient
to bring hir to the racke : though in all other cases it be directlie
against lawe.

Item, in presumptions and suspicions against a witch, the common
brute or voice of the people cannot erre.

Item, if a woman, when she is apprehended, crie out, or saie ; I
am undoone ; Save my life ; I will tell you how the matter standeth,
&c : she is thereupon most vehementlie to be suspected and con-
demned to die. 

Item, though a conjurer be not to be condemned for curing the
diseased by vertue of his art : yet must a witch die for the like case.

Item, the behaviour, looks, becks, and countenance of a woman,
are sufficient signes, whereby to presume she is a witch : for alwais
they looke downe to the ground, and dare not looke a man full in
the face.

Item, if their parents were thought to be witches, then is it
certeinlie to be presumed that they are so : but it is not so to be
thought of whoores.

Item, it is a vehement presumption if she cannot weepe, at the

time of hir examination : and yet Bodin saith, that a witch may shed
three drops out of hir right eie.

Item, it is not onelie a vehement suspicion, and presumption, but
an evident proofe of a witch, if any man or beast die suddenhe where
she hath beene seene latelie ; although hir witching stuffe be not
found or espied.

Item, if any bodie use familiaritie or companie with a witch
convicted ; it is a sufficient presumption against that person to be
adjudged a witch. 

Item, that evidence that may serve to bring in any other person to
examination, may serve to bring a witch to her condemnation.

Item, herein judgment must be pronounced & executed (as Bodin
saith) without order, and not like to the orderlie proceeding and forme
of judgement in other crimes.

Item, a witch may not be brought to the torture suddenlie, or before
long examination, least she go awaie scotfree : for they feele no
torments, and therefore care not for the same (as Bodin affirmeth.)

Item, little children may be had to the torture at the first dash ;
but so may it not be doone with old women : as is aforesaid.

Item, if she have anie privie marke under hir arme pokes, under
hir haire, under hir lip, or in hir buttocke, or in hir privities : it is a
presumption sufficient for the judge to proceed and give sentence of
death upon hir.

The onlie pitie they shew to a poore woman in this case, is ; that
though she be accused to have slaine anie bodie with her inchant-
ments ; yet if she can bring foorth the partie alive, she shall not be
put to death. Whereat I marvell, in as much as they can bring the
divell in any bodies likenesse and representation.

Item, their lawe saith, that an uncerteine presumption is sufficient,
when a certeine presumption faileth.

same ; supposing that the ci  ting of such absurdities may stand for
a suffici ent confutation thereof. Now therefore I will proceed to a

First the witch must be demanded, why she touched such a child,
or such a cow, &c : and afterward the same child or cow fell sicke
or lame, &c.

Item, why hir two kine give more milke than hir neighbors. And
the note before mentioned is heere againe set downe, to be speciallie
observed of all men : to wit ; that Though a witch cannot weepe, yet
she may speake with a crieng voice. Which assertion of weeping is
false, and contrarie to the saieng of Seneca., Cato, and manie others ;
which affirme, that A woman weepeth when she meaneth most deceipt :
and therefore saith AI. Mai. she must be well looked unto, otherwise
she will put spettle privilie upon hir cheeks, and seeme to weepe :
which rule also Bodin saith is infallible. But alas that teares should
be thought sufficient to excuse or condemne in so great a cause, and so
weightie a triall ! I am sure that the woorst sort of the children of
Israel wept bitterlie : yea, if there were any witches at all in Israel,
they wept. For it is written, that all the children of Israel wept.
Finallie, if there be any witches in hell, I am sure they weepe : for
there is weeping, wailing, and gnashing of teeth.

But God knoweth, many an honest matrone cannot sometimes in
the heavines of her heart shed teares ; the which oftentimes are
more readie and common with craftie queanes and strumpets, than
with sober women. For we read of two kinds of teares in a womans
eie, the one of true greefe, the other of deceipt. And it is written,
that Dediscere flet-e faininam est mendaciiivi : which argueth, that
they lie which say, that wicked women cannot weepe. But let these
tormentors take heed, that the teares in this case which runne downe the
widowes cheeks, with their crie spoken of by Jesus Sirach, be not
heard above. But lo what learned, godlie, and lawfull meanes these
popish inquisitors have invented for the triall of true or false teares. 

The seventh Chapter.

The eight Chapter.

Certaine cautions agaitist witches, and of their tortures to procure
cotifcssion.

|UT to manifest their further follies, I will recite some of
their cautions, which are published by the ancient inquisi-
tors, for perpetuall lessons to their successors : as followeth.
The first caution is that, which was last rehearsed con-
cerning weeping ; the which (say they) is an infallible note.

Secondlie, the judge must beware she touch no part of him,
speciallie of his bare ; and that he alwaies weare about his necke
conjured salt, palme, herbes, and waxe halowed : which (say they) are Ja. Sprenger.
not onelie approoved to be good by the witches confessions ; but  also ' '" ' °^'
by the use of the Romish church, which halloweth them onelie for
that purpose.

Item, she must come to hir arreignement backward, to wit, with hir Mai. male.
taile to the judges face, who must make manie crosses, at the time of ^*' ^' ^"'^' '^'
hir approching to the barre. And least we should condemne that
for superstition, they prevent us with a figure, and tell us, that the proUpsis or
same superstition may not seeme superstitious unto us. But this P' inoccupation.
resembleth the persuasion of a theefe, that dissuadeth his sonne from
stealing ; and neverthelesse telleth him that he may picke or cut a
pursse, and rob by the high waie.

One other caution is, that she must be shaven, so as there remaine
not one haire about hir : for sometimes they keepe secrets for tacitur-
nitie, and for other purposes also in their haire, in their privities, and
betweene their skinne and their flesh. For which cause I marvell
they flea them not: for one of their witches would not burne, being in
the middest of the flame, as M. Mai. reporteth ; untill a charme 3[al. male.
written in a little scroll was espied to be hidden betweene hir skin
and flesh, and taken awaie. And this is so gravelie and faithfullie
set downe by the inquisitors themselves, that one may beleeve it if
he list, though indeed it be a verie lie. The like lie citeth Bodin, of John. Bod.
a witch that could not be strangled by the executioner, doo what he ^.nno 14S5 a
could. But it is most true, that the inquisitor Cumamcs in one yeare i^nave inquisi-
did shave one and fourtie poore women, and burnt them all when he
had done.

Another caution is, that at the time and place of torture, the hal- Q. id.detem-
lowed things aforesaid, with the seaven words spoken on the crosse, be ^inurrog^ "
hanged about the witches necke ; and the length of Christ in waxe be
knit about hir bare naked bodie, with relikes of saints, &c. All which
stuffe (saie they) will so worke within and upon them, as when they

are racked and tortured, they can hardlie staie or hold themselves

from confession. In which case I doubt not but that pope, which

Blasphemous blasphemed Christ, and curssed his mother for a pecocke, and curssed

thafname'the ^^"^ ^^'*-^^ great despights for a peece of porke, with lesse compulsion

third. would have renounced the trinitie, and have worshipped the divell

1. upon his knees.

Another caution is, that after she hath beene racked, and hath

passed over all tortures devised for that purpose ; and after that she

3^- hath beene compelled to drinke holie water, she be conveied  againe

to the place of torture : and that in the middest of hir torments, hir

accusations be read unto hir ; and that the witnesses (if they will) be

brought face to face unto hir : and finallie, that she be asked, whether

Mai. male. for triall of hir innocencie she will have judgement, Candentiserrz,

par. 3, qua. . ^y^jf^jj jg . '^q carrie a certeine weight of burning iron in hir bare hand.

But that may not (saie they) in anie wise be granted. For both

Af. Mai. and Bodin also affirme, that manie things may be promised,

but nothing need be performed : for whie, they have authoritie to

promise, but no commission to performe the same.

Another caution is, that the judge take heed, that when she once
beginneth to confesse, he cut not off hir examination, but continue it
night and dale. For many-times, whiles they go to dinner, she re-
turneth to hir vomit.

Another caution is, that after the witch hath confessed the annoie-
ing of men and beasts, she be asked how long she hath had Incicbiis,
when she renounced the faith, and made the reall league, and what
that league is, &c. And this is indeede the cheefe cause of all their
incredible and impossible confessions : for upon the racke, when they
have once begunne to lie, they will saie what the tormentor list.

The last caution is, that if she will not confesse, she be had to some
strong castle or gaole. And after certeine dales, the gaolor must
make hir beleeve he goeth foorth into some farre countrie : and then
some of hir freends must come in to hir, and promise hir, that if she
will confesse to them, they will suffer hir to escape out of prison :
which they may well doo, the keeper being from home. And this
Mai. male. waie (saith M. Mai.) hath served, when all other meanes have failed,

fl^r^^"^ '^ "^"^ ^^ '•^'^ place it may not be omitted, that above all other times,

they confesse upon fridaies. Now ssXih James Spretiger, and Henrie
Instifor, we must saie all, to wit : If she confesse nothing, she should
be dismissed by lawe ; and yet by order she may in no wise be bailed,
but must be put into close prison, and there be talked withall by
some craftie person (those are the words) and in the meane while
there must be some eves-dropers with pen and inke behind the wall,
to hearken and note what she confesseth : or else some of hir old

matters, and so by eves-droppers be also bewraied ; so as there shall
be no end of torture before she have confessed what they will. 22

The Ninth Chapter.

speciallie by Bodin, in Dccmonomania.

HEY denie God, and all religion. I

Aiistvere* Then let them die therefore, or at the least [*Rom.]
be used like infidels, or apostataes.

They cursse, blaspheme, and provoke God with all 2
despite.

AnsTuere* Then let them have the law expressed in Levit. 24. and
Deut. 13. & 17.

They give their faith to the divell, and they worship and offer sacri- 3
fice unto him.

Atts. Let such also be judged by the same lawe.

They doo solemnelie vow and promise all their progenie unto the 4
divell.

Alls. This promise proceedeth from an unsound mind, and is not
to be regarded ; bicause they cannot performe it, neither will it be
prooved true. Howbeit, if it be done by anie that is sound of mind,
let the cursse of Jefemie. 32. 36. light upon them, to wit, the sword,
famine and pestilence.

They sacrifice their owne children to the divell before baptisme, 5
holding them up in the aire unto him, and then thrust a needle into
their braines.

Afis. If this be true, I maintaine them not herein : but there is a
lawe to judge them by. Howbeit, it is so contrarie to sense and
nature, that it were foUie to beleeve it ; either upon Bodins bare word,
or else upon his presumptions ; speciallie when so small commoditie
and so great danger and inconvenience insueth to the witches thereby.

They burne their children when they have sacrificed them. 5

A71S. Then let them have such punishment, as they that offered
their children unto Moloch : Levit. 20. But these be meere  devises 33-
of witchmoongers and inquisitors, that with extreame tortures
have Avroong such confessions from them ; or else with false reports
have beelied them ; or by flatterie & faire words and promises have
woon it at their hands, at the length.

They sweare to the divell to bring as manie into that societie as pr
they can.

Alls. This is false, and so prooved elsewhere.

8 They sweare by the name of the divell.

Ans. I never heard anie such oth, neither have we warrant to kill
them that so doo sweare ; though indeed it be verie lewd and impious.

9 They use incestuous adulterie with spirits.

Ans. This is a stale ridiculous lie, as is prooved apparentlie
hereafter.

10 They boile infants (after they have murthered them unbaptised)
untill their flesh be made potable.

23. A7ts. This is untrue, incredible, and impossible.

1 1 They eate the ilesh and drinke the bloud of men and children
openlie.

Ans. Then are they kin to the Anthropophagi and Canibals. But
I beleeve never an honest man in Englatid nor in France, will affirme
that he hath seene any of these persons, that are said to be witches,
do so ; if they shuld, I beleeve it would poison them.

12 They kill men with poison.

Ans. Let them be hanged for their labour.

13 They kill mens cattell.

Ans. Then let an action of trespasse be brought against them for
so dooing.

14 They bewitch mens corne, and bring hunger and barrennes into
the countrie ; they ride and flie in the aire, bring stormes, make
tempests, &c.

Ans. Then will I worship them as gods ; for those be not the
works of man, nor yet of witch : as I have elsewhere prooved at
large.

1 5 They use venerie with a divell called Incubus, even when they lie
in bed with their husbands, and have children by them, which become
the best witches.

Ans. This is the last lie, verie ridiculous, and confuted by me else-
34 where.

In this libell you dooe see is conteined all that witches are charged

with ; and all that also, which anie witchmoonger surmiseth, or in

malice imputeth unto witches power and practise.

Chap. 10.

Some of these crimes may not onelie be in the power and will of a
witch, but may be accomplished by naturall meanes : and therefore by
them the matter in question is not decided, to wit ; Whether a witch
can worke woonders supernaturallie ? For manie a knave and whore
dooth more commonlie put in execution those lewd actions, than such
as are called witches, and are hanged for their labour.

Some of these crimes also laid unto witches charge, are by me
denied, and by them cannot be prooved to be true, or committed by
any one witch. Othersome of these crimes likewise are so absurd,
supernaturall, and impossible, that they are derided almost of all men,
and as false, fond, and fabulous reports condemned : insomuch as the
very witchmoongers themselves are ashamed to heare of them.

If part be untrue, why may not the residue be thought false 1 For
all these things are laid to their charge at one instant, even by the
greatest doctors and patrones of the sect of witchmongers, producing
as manie proofs for witches supernaturall and impossible actions, as
for the other. So as, if one part of their accusation be false, the other
part deserveth no credit. If all be true that is alledged of their
dooings, why should we beleeve in Christ, bicause of his miracles,
when a witch dooth as great wonders as ever he did 1

But it will be said by some ; As for those absurd and popish
writers, they are not in all their allegations, touching these matters, to
be credited. But I assure you, that even all sorts of writers heerein
(for the most part) the very doctors of the church to the schoolemen,
protestants and papists, learned and unlearned, poets and historio-
graphers, Jewes, Christians, or Gentiles agree in these impossible
and ridiculous matters. Yea and these writers, out of whome I gather
most absurdities, are of the best credit and authoritie of all writers in
this matter. The reason is, bicause it was never throughlie looked
into ; but everie fable credited ; and the word (Witch) named so often
in scripture.

They that have scene further of the inquisitors orders and customes,
saie also ; that There is no waie in the world for these poore women
to escape the inquisitors hands, and so consequentlie burning : but to
gild their hands with monie, wherb}^ oftentimes they take pitie upon
them, and deliver them, as sufficientlie purged. For they have
authoritie to exchange the punishment of the bodie with the punish-
ment of the pursse, applieng the same to the office of their inquisi-
tion ; whereby they reape such profit, as a number of
these seelie women paie them yeerelie pen-
sions, to the end they may
not be punished
againe.

A bitter invec-
tive against a
cruell inquisitor.




The opinion of Corjielius Agrippa concerning witches, of his
pleading for a poore woman accused of witchcraft, and how he
convinced the inquisitors.

\ORNELIUS AGRIPPA saith, that while he was in
Italic, mania inquisitors in the dutchie oiMillen troubled
divers most honest & noble matrones, privilie wringing
much monie from them, untill their knaverie was
detected. Further he saith, that being an advocate or councellor
in the Commonwelth of Maestriglit in Brabant, he had sore
contention with an inquisitor, who through unjust accusations
drew a poore woman of thp countrie into his butcherie, and to an unfit
place ; not so much to examine hir, as to torment hir. Whom when
C. Agrippa had undertaken to defend, declaring that in the things
doone, there was no proofe, no signe or token that could cause hir to
be tormented ; the inquisitor stoutlie denieng it, said ; One thing
there is, which is proofe and matter sufficient : for hir mother was in
times past burned for a witch. Now when Agrippa replied, affirming
that this article was impertinent, and ought to be refused by the judge,
as being the deed of another ; alledging to the inquisitor, reasons and
lawe for the same : he replied againe that this was true, bicause they
used to sacrifice their children to the divell, as soone as they were
borne ; and also bicause they usuallie conceived by spirits transformed
into mans shape, and that thereby witchcraft was naturallie ingraffed
into this child, as a disease that commeth by inheritance. 

C. Agrippa replieng against the inquisitors foUie & superstitious
blindnesse, said ; O thou wicked preest ! Is this thy divinitie.'' Doost
thou use to drawe poore guiltlesse women to the racke by these forged
devises ? Doost thou with such sentences judge others to be heretikes,
thou being a more heretike than either Faiistiis or Donatus ? Be it
as thou saiest, dooest thou not frustrate the grace of Gods ordinance ;
namelie baptisme? Are the words in baptisme spoken in vaine? Or
shall the divell rem.aine in the child, or it in the power of the divell,
being there and then consecrated to Christ Jesus, in the name of the
father, the sonne, and the holie ghost ? And if thou defend their
false opinions, which affirm, that spirits accompanieng with women,
can ingender ; yet dotest thou more than anie of them, which never
beleeved that anie of those divels, togither with their stolne seed, doo
put part of that their seed or nature into the creature. But though
indeed we be borne the children of the divell and damnation, yet
in baptisme, through grace in Christ, sathan is cast out, and we are



of Witchcraft.

made new creatures in the Lord, from whome none can be separated
by another mans deed. The inquisitor being hereat offended,
threatened the advocate to proceed against him, as a supporter of
heretikes or witches ; yet neverthelesse he ceased not to defend the
seehe woman, and through the power of the lawe he deHvered hir 
from the clawes of the bloodie moonke, who with hir accusers, were
condemned in a great summe of monie to the charter of the church
oi Mentz, and remained infamous after that time almost to all men.

But by the waie you must understand, that this was but a petie in-
quisitor, and had not so large a commission as Ctunanns, Sprenger,
and such other had ; nor yet as the Spanish inquisitors at this dale
have. For these will admit no advocats now unto the poore soules,
except the tormentor or hangman may be called an advocate. You
may read the summe of this inquisition in few words set out by M.
John Fox in the Acts and monuments. For witches and heretikes
are among the inquisitors of like reputation ; saving that the ex-
tremitie is greater against witches, bicause through their simplicitie,
they may the more boldlie tyrannize upon them, and triumph over
them.

What the feare of death and feeling of torments may force one to

E that readeth the ecclesiasticall histories, or remembreth
the persecutions in Queene Maries time, shall find, that
manie good men have fallen for feare of persecution, and
returned unto the Lord againe. What marvell then,
though a poore woman, such a one as is described else-where, &
tormented as is declared in these latter leaves, be made to confesse
such absurd and false impossibilities ; when flesh and bloud is
unable to endure such triall ? Or how can she in the middest of such
horrible tortures and torments, promise unto hir selfe constancie ; or 34.
forbeare to confesse anie thing ? Or what availeth it hir, to persevere
in the deniall of such matters, as are laid to her charge unjustlie ;
when on the one side there is never anie end of hir torments ; on
the other side,  if she continue in hir assertion, they saie she hath 38.

cunning inquisitors, who having the spoile of their goods, and bringing
with them into the place of judgement minds to maintaine their bloudie
purpose, spare no maner of aUurements, thretenings, nor torments,
untill they have wroong out of them all that, which either maketh
to their owne desire, or serveth to the others destruction.

Peter (I saie) in the presence of his Lord and maister Christ, who
had instructed him in true knowledge manie yeares, being fore-
warned, not passing foure or five houres before, and having made a
reall league and a faithfull promise to the contrarie, without anie
other compulsion than (as hath beene said) by a question proposed by
a girle, against his conscience, forsooke, thrise denied, and aban-
doned his said maister : and yet he was a man illuminated, and placed
in dignitie aloft, and neerer to Christ by manie degrees, than the
witch, whose fall could not be so great as Peters ; bicause she never
ascended halfe so manie steps. A pastors declination is much more
abhominable that the going astraie of anie of his sheepe : as an ambas-
sadors conspiracie is more odious than the falshood of a common
person : or as a capteins treason is more mischeevous than a private
soldiers mutinie. If you saie, Peter repented ; I answer that the
witch dooth so likewise sometimes, and I see not in that case, but
mercie may be emploied upon hir. It were a mightie temptation to a
seelie old woman, that a visible divell (being in shape so ugglie, as
Danceus in DaucEus and Others saie he is) should assalt hir in maner and forme

as is supposed, or rather avowed ; speciallie when there is promise
I Cor. 10. made that none shall be tempted above their strength. The poore

old witch is commonlie unlearned, unwarned, and unprovided of
counsell and freendship, void of judgement and discretion to moderate
hir life and communication, hir kind and gender more weake and
fraile than the masculine, and much more subject to melancholie ; hir
39- bringing up and companie is so base, that nothing is to be  looked for
in hir speciallie of these extraordinarie qualities ; hir age also is com-
monlie such, as maketh her decrepite, which is a disease that mooveth
them to these follies.

Finallie, Christ did cleerelie remit Peter, though his offense were
committed both against his divine and humane person : yea after-
wards he did put him in trust to feed his sheepe, and shewed
great countenance, freendship and love unto him. And there-
fore I see not, but we may shew compassion upon
these poore soules ; if they shew themselves
sorrowfull for their misconceipts
and wicked imagina-
tions.

The witches bargaine with the divell, according to M. Mai. Bodin,
Nider, Dmiaus, Pselltts, Erasfies, Hemingins, Ct<jnantes, Aqitifias,
Bartholomaus Spinetes, ^'c.

|HAT which in this matter of witchcraft hath abused so
mania, and seemeth both so horrible and intollerable, is
a plaine bargaine, that (they saie) is made betwixt the
divell and the witch. And manie of great learning con-
ceive it to be a matter of truth, and in their writings publish it
accordinglie : the which (by Gods grace) shall be prooved as vaine
and false as the rest.

The order of their bargaine or profession is double ; the one The double
solemne and publike ; the other secret and private. That which is witches with

assemblies, at the times prefixed, and doo not onelie see the divell in
visible forme ; but confer and talke familiarlie with him. In which
conference the divell exhorteth them to observe their fidelitie unto
him, promising them long life and prosperitie. Then the witches
assembled, commend a new disciple (whom they call a novice) unto
him : and if the divell find that yoong witch apt and forward in re-
nunciation of christian faith, in despising anie of the seven sacra-
ments, in treading upon crosses, in spetting at the time of the
elevation, in breaking their fast on fasting dales, and fasting on sun-
daies ; then the divell giveth foorth  his hand, and the novice joining 41.
hand in hand with him, promiseth to observe and keepe all the divels
commandements.

This done, the divell beginneth to be more bold with hir, telling
hir plainlie, that all this will not serve his turne ; and there-
fore requireth homage at hir hands : yea he also telleth hir, that she ■^^«^- male.

into this societie. Then he teacheth them to make ointments of the

accomplish all their desires. So as, if there be anie children unbap-
tised, or not garded with the signe of the crosse, or orizons ; then the
witches may and doo catch them from their mothers sides in the
night, or out of their cradles, or otherwise kill them with their cere-

monies ; and after buriall steale them out of their graves, and seeth

whereof they make ointments, whereby they ride in the aire ; but the
thinner potion they put into flaggons, whereof whosoever drinketh,
observing certeine ceremonies, immediatlie becommeth a maister or
rather a mistresse in that practise and facultie.

The second Chapter.

The order of the witches homage done {as it is written by lewd
inquisitors and peevish witchmoongers) to the divell in person ; of
their songs and danses, and nanielie of La volta, and of other
ceremonies, also of their exconrses.

[jOMETIMES their homage with their oth and bai'gaine
is received for a certeine terme of yeares ; sometimes for
ever. Sometimes it consisteth in the deniall of the
whole faith, sometimes in part. The first is, when the
soule is absolutelie yeelded to the divell and hell fier : the other is,
when they have but bargained [not] to  observe certeine ceremonies
and statutes of the church ; as to conceale faults at shrift, to fast on
sundaies, &c. And this is doone either by oth, protestation of words,
or by obligation in writing, sometimes sealed with wax, sometimes
signed with bloud, sometimes by kissing the divels bare buttocks ; as
did a Doctor called Edliti, who as {Bodift saith) was burned for
witchcraft.

You must also understand, that after they have delicatlie banketted
with the divell and the ladie of the fairies ; and have eaten up a fat
oxe, and emptied a butt of malmesie, and a binne of bread at some
noble mans house, in the dead of the night, nothing is missed of all
this in the morning. For the ladie Sibylla, Minerva, or Diana with
a golden rod striketh the vessell & the binne, and they are fullie re-
plenished againe. Yea, she causeth the bullocks bones to be brought
and laid togither upon the hide, and lappeth the foure ends thereof
togither, laieng her golden rod thereon ; and then riseth up the bul-
locke againe in his former estate and condition : and yet at their
returne home they are like to starve for hunger ; as Spineus saith. And
this must be an infallible rule, that everie fortnight, or at the least everie
moneth, each witch must kill one child at the least for hir part.

And here some of Monsieur Bodins lies may be inserted, who saith
that at these magicall assemblies, the witches never faile to danse ;
and in their danse they sing these words ; Har har, divell divell,
danse here, danse here, plaie here, plaie here. Sabbath, sabbath. And
whiles they sing and danse, everie one hath a broome in hir hand,



of Witchcraft. chap. 3. 33

and holdeth it up aloft. Item he saith, that these night-walking or
rather night-dansing witches, brought out of Italie into France, that
danse, which is called La volta.

A part of their league is, to scrape off the oile, which is received Mai. maUf.
in extreame follie (unction I should have said). But if that be so
dangerous, they which socke the corps had neede to take great
care, that they rub not off the oile, which divers other waies may
also be thrust out of the forehead ; and then I perceive all the ver-
tue thereof is gone, and farewell it. But I marvell how they
take on to preserve the water powred on them in baptisme,
which I take to be largelie of as great force as the other ; and yet
I thinke is commonlie wiped and washed off, within foure and
twentie houres  after baptisme : but this agreeth with the residue  ST. 43-
of their follie.

And this is to be noted, that the inquisitors affirme, that during the
whole time of the witches excourse, the divell occupieth the roome
and place of the witch, in so perfect a similitude, as hir husband in
his bed, neither by feeling, speech, nor countenance can discerne hir
from his wife. Yea the wife departeth out of her husbands armes
insensiblie, and leaveth the divell in hir roome visiblie. Wherein their
incredulitie is incredible, who will have a verie bodie in the feined
plaie, and a phantasticall bodie in the true bed : and yet (forsooth) at
the name of Jesus, or at the signe of the crosse, all these bodihe Griiiandus.

aire ; and that then they fall a dansing and singing of bawdie songs,
wherein he leadeth the danse himselfe. Which danse, and other
conferencies being ended, he supplieth their wants of powders and

with his teeth or with his clawes, and so they kisse the divels bare

him, dogs, cats, hens, or bloud of their ovvne. And all this dooth
DancEUS report as a troth, and as it were upon his owne knowledge.
And yet else-where he saieth ; In these matters theydoo but dreame,
and doo not those things indeed, which they confesse through their
distemperature, growing of their melancholike humor : and there-
fore (saith he) these things, which they report of themselves, are but
meere illusions.

Psellus addeth hereunto, that certeine magicall heretikes, to wit ;
the Eutychians, assemblie themselves everie good fridaie at night ;
and putting out the candles, doo commit incestuous adulterie, the
father with the daughter, the sister with the brother, and the sonne
with the mother ; and the ninth moneth they returne and are delivered ;
and cutting their children in peeces, fill their pots with their bloud ;
then burne they the carcases, and mingle the ashes therewith, and so
preserve the same for magicall purposes. Cardamis writeth (though

38. in mine opinion not verie probablie) that these excourses, dansmgs,
&c : had their beginning from certeine heretikes called Dukinz, vvho
devised those feasts of Bacchus which are named Orgi'a, whereunto
these kind of people openlie assembled ; and beginning with riot,
ended with this follie. Which feasts being prohibited, they never-
theles hanted them secretlie ; and when they rould not doo so, then
did they it in cogitation onelie, and even to this daie (saith he) there
remaineth a certeine image or resemblance thereof among our
melancholike women.

The fourth Chapter.

That there cajt no reall league be made with the divell the first
author of the league.^ and the iveake proof es of the adi'crsaries for
the same.

If the league be untrue, as are the residue of their
confessions, the witchmongers arguments fall to the
ground : for all the writers herein hold this bargaine
for certeine, good, and granted, and as their onelie
43. maxime. But surelie the indentures, conteining those covenants,
are sealed with butter ; and the labels are but babies. What firme
bargaine can be made betwixt a carnall bodie and a spirituall } Let
any wise or honest man tell me, that either hath beene a partie, or a
witnesse ; and I will beleeve him. But by what authoritie, proofe, or
testimonie ; and upon what ground all this geere standeth, if you read
M. Mai. you shall find, to the shame of the reporters (who doo so

varie in their tales, and are at such contrarietie :) and to the reproch
of the beleevers of such absurd lies.

For the beginning of the credit hereof, resteth upon the confession Upon what
of a baggage yoong fellow condemned to be burnt for witchcraft ; feaUeague
who said to the inquisitors, of likelihood to prolong his life, (if at 'o<^&^ 50

. , ^ , . growe in

leastwise the storie be true, which is taken out of Nider ;) If I wist credit.
(quoth he) that I might obteine pardon, 1 would discover all that I
knowe of witchcraft. The which condition being accepted, and
pardon promised (partlie in hope thereof, and partlie to be rid of his
wife) he said as followeth.

The novice or yoong disciple goeth to some church, togither with
the mistresse of that profession, upon a sundaie morning, before the
conjuration of holie water, &^ there the said novice renounceth the
faith, promiseth obedience in observing, or rather omitting of
ceremonies in meetings, and such other follies ; and finallie, that
they doo homage to their yoong maister the divell, as they covenanted.

But this is notable in that storie, that this yoong witch, doubting
that his wives examination would bewraie his knaverie, told the
inquisitor; that in truth his wife was guiltie as well as he, but she will
never, I am sure (quoth he) though she should be burned a thousand
times, confesse any of these circumstances.

And this is in no wise to be forgotten, that notwithstanding his
contrition, his confession, and his accusation of his owne wife (con-
trarie to the inquisitors  promise and oth) he and his wife were both 39-
burned at a stake, being the first discoverers of this notable league,
whereupon the fable of witchcraft is mainteined ; and whereby such
other confessions have beene from the like persons, since that time,
extorted and augmented. 

The fift Chapter. 46-

Of the private league, a notable tale of Bodins concerning a French

consent privilie, and come not into the fairies assemblie.

And in this case (mee thinks) the divell sometimes, in such exlernall
or corporall shape, should meete with some that would not consent to
his motions (except you will saie he knoweth their cogitations) and so

should be bewraied. They also (except they were idiots) would spie
him, and forsake him for breach of covenants. But these bargaines,
and these assemblies doo all the writers hereupon mainteine : and
Bodin confirmeth them with a hundred and odd lies ; among the
number whereof I will (for diverse causes) recite one.

There was (saith he) a noble Gentlewoman at Lions, that being in
bed with a lover of hirs, suddenlie in the night arose up, and lighted
a candle : which when she had done, she tooke a box of ointment,
wherewith she annointed her bodie ; and after a few words spoken,
she was carried awaie. Hir bedfellow seeing the order hereof, lept
out of his bed, tooke the candle in his hand, and sought for the ladie
round about the chamber, and in everie corner thereof But though
he could not find hir, yet did he find hir box of ointment : and being
desirous to know the vertue thereof, besmeered himselfe therewith,
even as he perceived hir to have done before. And although he were
not so superstitious, as to use anie words to helpe him forward in his
busines, yet by the vertue of that ointment (saith Bodhi) he was
immediatlie conveied  to Lorreine, into the assemblie of witches.
Which when he sawe, he was abashed, and said ; In the name of
God, what make I heere? And upon those words the whole assemblie
vanished awaie, and left him there alone starke naked ; and so was
he faine to returne to Lions. But he had so good a conscience (for
you may perceive by the first part of the historie, he was a verie
honest man) that he accused his true lover for a witch, and caused
hir to be burned. But as for his adulterie, neither M. Mai. nor Bodin
doo once so much as speake in the dispraise thereof

It appeareth throughout all Bodins booke, that he is sore offended
with Cornelius Agrippa, and the rather (as I suppose) bicause the
said C. Agrippa recanted that which Bodin mainteineth, who thinketh
he could worke wonders by magicke, and speciallie by his blacke dog.
It should seeme he had prettie skill in the art of divination. For
though he wrote before Bodin mania a yeare, yet uttereth he these
words in his booke De vanitate scientiarum : A certeine French
protonotarie (saith he) a lewd fellow and a coosener, hath written
a certeine fable or miracle done at Lions, &^c. What
Bodin is, I knowe not, otherwise than by report ; but
I am certeine this his tale is a fond fable : and
Bodin saith it was performed at Lions ;

stand) by profession

Tatianus 4'

HAT the joining of hands with the divell, the kissing
of his bare buttocks, and his scratching and biting
of them, are absurd lies ; everie one having the gift
of reason may plainHe perceive : in so much as it
is manifest unto us by the word of God, that a spirit hath no
flesh, bones, nor sinewes, whereof hands, buttocks, claws, teeth,
and lips doo consist. For admit that the constitution of a divels
bodie (as Tatian and other afifirme) consisteth in spirituall  congela-
tions, as of fier and aire ; yet it cannot be perceived of mortall
creatures. What credible witnesse is there brought at anie time, of
this their corporall, visible, and incredible bargaine ; saving the con-
fession of some person diseased both in bodie and mind, wilfullie
made, or injuriouslie constrained? It is mervell that no penitent
witch that forsaketh hir trade, confesseth not these things without
compulsion. Mee thinketh their covenant made at baptisme with
God, before good witnesses, sanctified with the word, confirmed with
his promises, and established with his sacraments, should be of more
force than that which they make with the divell, which no bodie
seeth or knoweth. For God deceiveth none, with whom he bargaineth ;
neither dooth he mocke or disappoint them, although he danse not
among them.

Their oth, to procure into their league and fellowship as manie as
they can (whereby everie one witch, as Bodin afifirmeth, augmenteth
the number of fiftie) bewraieth greatlie their indirect dealing.
Hereof I have made triall, as also of the residue of their coosening The author
devices ; and have beene with the best, or rather the woorst of them, u^^n^d*
to see what might be gathered out of their counsels; and have proofeand
cunninglie treated with them thereabouts : and further, have sent
certeine old persons to indent with them, to be admitted into their
societie. But as well by their excuses and delaies, as by other
circumstances, I have tried and found all their trade to be meere
coosening.

I praie you what bargaine have they made with the divell, that
with their angrie lookes beewitch lambs, children, &c? Is it not
confessed, that it is naturall, though it be a lie? What bargaine
maketh the soothsaier, which hath his severall kinds of witchcraft
and divination expressed in the scripture? Or is it not granted that
they make none? How chanceth it that we heare not of this bargaine
in the scriptures?

The seventh Chapter,

A confutation of the objection concerning witches confessions.

It is confessed (saie some by the waie of objection)
even of these women themselves, that they doo these
and such other horrible things, as deserveth death,
with all extremitie, &c. Whereunto I answer, that
whosoever consideratelie beholdeth their confessions, shall perceive
all to be vaine, idle, false, inconstant, and of no weight; except their
contempt and ignorance in religion : which is rather the fault of the
negligent pastor, than of the simple woman.

First, if their confession be made by compulsion, of force or
authoritie, or by persuasion, and under colour of freendship, it is not
to be regarded ; bicause the extremitie of threts and tortures pro-
vokes it ; or the qualitie of faire words and allurements constraines it.
If it be voluntarie, manie circumstances must be considered, to wit ;
whether she appeach not hir selfe to overthrow hir neighbour, which
manie times happeneth through their cankered and malicious melan-
cholike humor : then ; whether in that same melancholike mood
and frentike humor, she desire not the abridgment of hir owne dales.
Which thing Aristotle saith dooth oftentimes happen unto persons
subject to melancholike passions : and (as Bodin and Sprenger saie)
to these old women called witches, which manie times (as they
affirme) refuse to live ; thretning the judges, that if they may not be
burned, they will laie hands upon themselves, and so make them
guiltie of their damnation.

I my selfe have knowne, that where such a one could not prevaile,
to be accepted as a sufficient witnesse against himselfe, he presentlie
went and threw himselfe into a pond of water, where he was drowned.
But the lawe saith ; Volenti niori non est habenda fides, that is ;
His word is not to be credited that is desirous to die. Also some-
times (as else-where I have prooved) they confesse that whereof they
were never guiltie ; supposing that they did that which they did not,
by meanes of certeine circumstances. And as they sometimes con-
fesse impossibilities, as that they flie in the aire, transubstantiate
themselves, raise tempests, transfer or remoove corne, &c : so doo
they also (I saie) confesse voluntarilie, that which no man could
proove, and that which no man would ghesse, nor yet beleeve, except
he were as mad as they ; so as they bring death wilfullie upon them-
selves : which argueth an unsound mind.

If they confesse that, which hath beene indeed committed by them,

as poisoning, or anie other kind of murther, which falleth into the
power of such persons to accomplish ; I stand not to defend their
cause. Howbeit, I would wish that even in that case there be not too
rash credit given, nor too hastie proceedings used against them: but
that the causes, properties, and circumstances of everie thing be dulie
considered, and diligentlie examined. For you shall understand, that
as sometimes they confesse they have murthered their neighbours with
a wish, sometimes with a word, sometimes with a looke, &c: so they
confesse, that with the delivering of an apple, or some such thing, to
a woman with child, they have killed the child in the mothers wombe,
when nothing was added thereunto, which naturallie could be noisome
or hurtfull.

In like maner they confesse, that with a touch of their bare hand,
they sometimes kill a man being in perfect health and strength of
bodie ; when all his garments are betwixt their hand and his flesh.

But if this their confession be examined by divinitie, philosophie,
physicke, lawe or conscience, it will be found false and insufficient.
First, for that the working of miracles is ceased. Secondlie, no
reason can be yeelded for a thing so farre beyond all reason. Third-
lie, no receipt can be of such efficacie, as when the same is touched
with a bare hand, from whence the veines have passage through the
bodie unto the hart, it should not annoie the poisoner ; and yet reteine
vertue and force enough, to pearse through so manie garments and
'the verie flesh incurablie, to the place of death in another person.
Cid ari^ionefito (saith Bodin) nescio qtdd  7'esponderi possit. Fourth-
lie, no lawe will admit such a confession, as yeeldeth unto im-
possibilities, against the which there is never any lawe provided ;
otherwise it would not serve a mans turne, to plead and proove that
he was at Berwicke that dale, that he is accused to have doone a
murther in Cajihirdurie ; for it might be said he was conveied to
Berwicke, and backe againe by inchantment. Fiftlie, he is not by con-
science to be executed, which hath no sound mind nor
perfect judgement. And yet forsooth we read, that
one mother Stile did kill one Saddocke with a touch
on the shoulder, for not keeping promise with
hir for an old cloake, to make hir a
safegard ; and that she was
hanged for hir
labour.

The eight Chapter.

IVliat follie it were for witches to enter into such desperate per ill,
and to endure such intolterable tortures for no gaine or commodi-
tie, and how it comes to passe that witches are overthrowne by
their cofifessions.

LAS ! if they were so subtill, as witchmongers make
them to be, they would espie that it were meere follie
for them, not onelie to make a bargaine with the
divell to throw their soules into hell fire, but their
bodies to the tortures of temporall fire and death, for the accom-
plishment of nothing that might benefit themselves at all : but
they would at the leastwise indent with the divell, both to inrich
them, and also to enoble them ; and finallie to endue them with all
worldlie felicitie and pleasure : which is furthest from them of all
other. Yea, if they were sensible, they would saie to the divell ; Whie
should I hearken to you, when you will deceive me ? Did you not
promise my neighbour mother Button to save and rescue hir ; and yet
lo she is hanged 1 Surelie this would appose the divell verie sore.
And it is a woonder, that none, from the beginning of the world, till
this dale, hath made this and such like objections, whereto the divell
could never  make answer. But were it not more madnes for them
to serve the divell, under these conditions ; and yet to endure
43. whippings with iron rods at the divels hands ; which (as the witch-
mongers write) are so set on, that the print of the lashes remaine
upon the witches bodie ever after, even so long as she hath a daie
to live ?

But these old women being daunted with authoritie, circumvented
with guile, constrained by force, compelled by feare, induced by error,
and deceived by ignorance, doo fall into such rash credulitie, and so
are brought unto these absurd confessions. Whose error of mind and
blindnes of will dependeth upon the disease and infirmitie of nature :
and therefore their actions in that case are the more to be borne
withall ; bicause they, being destitute of reason, can have no consent.
For, Delictum sine consensu non potest coinmitti., neque injuria
sine animo iitjuriandi ; that is. There can be no sinne without
consent, nor injurie committed without a mind to doo wrong.
Yet the lawe saith further, that A purpose reteined in mind, dooth
nothing to the privat or publike hurt of anie man ; and much more
that an impossible purpose is unpunishable. Sance mentis voluntas.,
volimtas rei possibilis est ; A sound mind willeth nothing but that
which is possible.

The ninth Chapter.

How melancholie abuseih old wojnen, and of the effects thereof by
sundrie examples.

F anie man advisedlie marke their words, actions, cogi-
tations, and gestures, he shall perceive that melancholie
abounding in their head, and occupieng their braine, hath
deprived or rather depraved their judgements, and all their
senses: I meane not of coosening witches, but of poore melancholike
women, which are themselves deceived. For you shall understand, that
the force which melancholie hath, and the effects that it worketh in the
bodie of a man, or rather of a woman, are almost incredible. For as
some of these melancholike persons imagine, they are witches and by 53'
witchcraft can worke woonders, and doo what they list : so doo other,
troubled with this disease, imagine manie strange, incredible, and im-
possible things. Some, that they are monarchs and princes, and that all
other men are their subjects : some, that they are brute beasts : some,
that they be urinals or earthen pots, greatlie fearing to be broken : some,
that everie one that meeteth them, will conveie them to the gallowes ;
and yet in the end hang themselves. One thought, that Atlas, whome
the poets feigne to hold up heaven with his shoulders, would be
wearie, and let the skie fall upon him : another would spend a
whole dale upon a stage, imagining that he both heard and saw
interludes, and therewith made himselfe great sport. One Theophilus
a physician, otherwise sound inough of mind (as it is said) imagined
that he heard and sawe musicians continuallie plaieng on instruments,
in a certeine place of his house. 0's\t.Bessus, that had killed his father,
was notablie detected ; by imagining that a swallowe upraided him
therewith : so as he himselfe thereby revealed the murther.

But the notablest example heereof is, of one that was in great 44.
perplexitie, imagining that his nose was as big as a house ; insomuch Of one that
as no freend nor physician could deliver him from this conceipt, nor meSlfchoiie
yet either ease his greefe, or satisfie his fansie in that behalfe : till at ^^s induced

•' . . to thinke that

the last, a physician more expert in this humor than the rest, used he had a nose
this devise following. First, when he was to come in at the chamber house, X-c.
doore being wide open, he suddenlie staled and withdrew himselfe ;
so as he would not in any wise approch neerer than the doore. The
melancholike person musing heereat, asked him the cause why he so
demeaned himselfe ? Who answered him in this maner : Sir, your
nose is so great, that I can hardlie enter into your chamber but I
shall touch it, and consequentlie hurt it. Lo (quoth he) this is the
man that must doo me good ; the residue of my freends flatter me,

and would hide mine infirmitie from me. Well (said the physician) I
will cure you, but you must be content to indure a little paine in the
dressing : which he promised patientlie to susteine, and conceived
certeine hope of his recoverie. Then entred the physician into the
chamber, creeping close by the walles, seeming to feare the touching
and hurting of his nose. Then did he blindfold him, which  being
doone, he caught him by the nose with a paire of pinsors, and threw
downe into a tub, which he had placed before his patient, a great
quantitie of bloud, with manie peeces of bullocks livers, which he had
conveied into the chamber, whilest the others eies were bound up,
and then gave him libertie to see and behold the same. He having
doone thus againe twoo or three times, the melancholike humor was
so qualified, that the mans mind being satisfied, his greefe was eased,
and his disease cured.

Thrasibuhis, otherwise called Thrasilhis, being sore oppressed
with this melancholike humor, imagined, that all the ships, which
arrived at port Pyrcetts, were his : insomuch as he would number
them, and command the mariners to lanch, &c : triumphing at their
safe returnes, and moorning for their misfortunes. The Italian, whom
we called here in England, the Monarch, was possessed with the like
spirit or conceipt. Danceus him.selfe reporteth, that he sawe one, that
affirmed constantlie that he was a cocke ; and saith that through
melancholie, such were alienated from themselves.

Now, if the fansie of a melancholike person may be occupied in
causes which are both false and impossible ; why should an old witch
be thought free from such fantasies, who (as the learned philosophers
and physicians saie) upon the stopping of their monethlie melancholike
flux or issue of bloud, in their age must needs increase therein, as
(through their weaknesse both of bodie and braine) the aptest
persons to meete with such melancholike imaginations : with whome
their imaginations remaine, even when their senses are gone. "Which
Bodin laboureth to disproove, therein shewing himselfe as good a
physician, as else-where a divine.

But if they may imagine, that they can transforme their owne
bodies, which neverthelesse remaineth in the former shape : how
much more credible is it, that they may falselie suppose they can hurt
and infeeble other mens bodies ; or which is lesse, hinder the com-
ming of butter ? &c. But what is it that they will not imagine, and
consequentlie confesse that they can doo ; speciallie being so earnestlie
persuaded thereunto, so sorelie tormented, so craftilie examined,
with such promises of favour, as wherby they imagine, that they shall
ever after live in great credit & welth ? &c.

If you read the executions doone upon witches, either in times past




of Witchcraft. chap. lo. 41

in other countries, or latelie in this land ; you shall see such im-
possibilities confessed, as none, having his right wits, will beleeve.
Among other like false confessions, we read that there was a witch Ant.Houin.
confessed at the time of hir death or execution, that she had raised
all the tempests, and procured all the frosts and hard weather that
happened in the winter 1565 : and that manie grave and wise men
beleeved hir.

The tenth Chapter.

That voluniarie confessions may be unirulie made, to the tindooing
of the confessors, and of the strana^e operation of melattcholie,
prooved by a familiar and late example.

UT that it may appeere, that even voluntarie confession
(in this case) may be untrulie made, though it tend to the
destruction of the confessor ; and that melancholic may
nioove imaginations to that effect : I will cite a notable
instance concerning this matter, the parties themselves being yet
alive, and dwelling in the parish of Sellenge in Kent, and the matter
not long sithence in this sort performed.

One Ade Davie, the wife of Simon Davie, husbandman, being a Kentish
reputed a right honest bodie, and being of good parentage, grew Lte'Lcident.
suddenlie (as hir husband informed mee, and as it is well knovvne in
these parts) to be somewhat pensive and more sad than in times past.
Which thing though it greeved him, yet he was loth to make it so
appeere, as either his wife might be troubled or discontented there-
with, or his neighbours informed thereof ; least ill husbandrie should
be laid to his charge (which in these quarters is much abhorred.) But
when she grew from pensivenes, to some perturbation of mind ; so as
hir accustomed rest began in the night season to be withdrawne from
hir, through sighing and secret lamentation ; and that, not without
teares, hee could not but demand the cause of hir conceipt and extra-
ordinarie moorning. But although at that time she covered the same, ^6.
acknowledging nothing to be amisse with hir : soone after notwith-
standing she fell downe before him on hir knees, desiring him to
forgive hir, for she had greevouslie offended (as she said) both God
& him. Hir poore husband being abashed at this hir behaviour,
comforted hir, as he could ; asking hir the cause of hir trouble &
greefe : who told him, that she had, (contrarie to Gods lawe) & to
the offense of all good christians, to the injurie of him, & speciallie to
the losse of hir owne soule, bargained and given hir soule to the
divell, to be delivered unto him within short space. Whereunto hir didstian
husband answered, saieng ; Wife, be of good cheere, this thybargaine comfort of the

thine to sell ; sith it belongeth to Christ, who hath bought it, and
''deerelie paid for it, even with his bloud, which he shed upon the
46. crosse ; so as the divell hath no interest in thee. After this, with like
submission, teares, and penitence, she said unto him ; Oh husband, I
have yet^^mmitted another fault, and doone you more injurie : for I
have bewitched you and your children. Be content (quoth he) by the
grace of God, Jesus Christ shall unwitch us : for none evill can
happen to them that feare God.

And (as trulie as the Lord liveth) this was the tenor of his words
unto me, which I knowe is true, as proceeding from unfeigned lips,
and from one that feareth God. Now when the time approched that
the divell should come, and take possession of the woman, according
to his bargaine, he watched and praied earnestlie, and caused his wife
to read psalmes and praiers for mercie at Gods hands : and suddenlie
about midnight, there was a great rumbling beelowe under his
chamber windowe, which amazed them exceedinglie. For they con-
ceived, that the divell was beelowe, though he had no power to come
up, bicause of their fervent praiers.
Confutation. He that noteth this womans first and second confession, freelie and

voluntarilie made, how everie thing concurred that might serve to
adde credit thereunto, and yeeld matter for hir condemnation, would
not thinke, but that if Bodhi were foreman of hir inquest, he would
crie ; Guiltie : & would hasten execution upon hir ; who would have
57- said as much before any judge in the world, if she had beene
examined ; and have confessed no lesse, if she had beene arraigned
therupon. But God knoweth, she was innocent of anie these crimes :
howbeit she was brought lowe and pressed downe with the weight of
this humor, so as both hir rest and sleepe were taken awaie from hir ;
& hir fansies troubled and disquieted with despaire, and such other
cogitations as grew by occasion thereof. And yet I beleeve, if any
mishap had insued to hir husband, or his children ; few witchmongers
would have judged otherwise, but that she had bewitched them. And
she (for hir part) so constanthe persuaded hir selfe to be a witch,
that she judged hir selfe worthie of death ; insomuch as being reteined
in hir chamber, she sawe not anie one carrieng a faggot to the fier,
but she would saie it was to make a fier to burne hir for witcherie.
But God knoweth she had bewitched none, neither insued there anie
hurt unto anie, by hir imagination, but unto hir selfe.

And as for the rumbling, it was by occasion of a sheepe, which was
flawed, and hoong by the wals, so as a dog came and devoured it ;
whereby grew the noise which I before mentioned : and she being
now recovered, remaineth a right honest woman, far from such
impietie, and ashamed of hir imaginations, which she perceiveth to
have growne through melancholie.

fUT in truth, this melancholike humor (as the best phy-
sicians affirme) is the cause of all their strange, impossible,
and incredible confessions : which are so fond, that I
woonder how anie man can be abused thereby. Howbeit,
these affections, though they appeare in the mind of man, yet are they
bred in the bodie, and proceed from this humor, which is the verie
dregs of bloud, nourishing and feeding those places, from whence pro-
ceed feares, cogitations, superstitions, fastings, labours, and such like.

This maketh sufferance of torments, and (as some saie) foresight of Aristotle de
things to come, and preserveth health, as being cold and drie : it ^<-'""''°-
maketh men subject to leanenesse, and to the quartane ague. They
that are vexed therewith, are destroiers of themselves, stout to suffer
injuries, fearefull to offer violence ; except the humor be hot. They
learne strange toongs with small Industrie (as Aristotle and others
affirme.)

If our witches phantasies were not corrupted, nor their wils con-
founded with this humor, they would not so voluntarilie and readilie
confesse that which calleth their life in question ; whereof they could
never otherwise be convicted. J. Bodin with his lawyers physicke
reasoneth contrarilie ; as though melancholic were furthest of all
from those old women, whom we call witches : deriding the most
famous and noble physician _(?;« JVier for his opinion in that behalfe.
But bicause I am no physician, I will set a physician to him ; namelie
Erastus, who hath these words, to wit, that These witches, through
their corrupt phantasie abounding with melancholike humors, by
reason of their old age, doo dreame and imagine they hurt those
things which they neither could nor doo hurt ; and so thinke they
knowe an art, which they neither have learned nor yet understand.

But whie should there be more credit given to witches, when they
saie they have made a reall bargaine with the divell, killed a cow, be-
witched butter, infeebled a child, forespoken hir neighbour, &c : than
when she confesseth that she transubstantiateth hir selfe, maketh it
raine or haile, flieth in the aire, goeth invisible, transferreth corne in
the grasse from one field to another? &:c. If you thinke that in the
one their confessions be sound, whie should you saie that they are
corrupt in the other ; the confession of all these things being made at

But you see the one to be impossible, and therefore you thinke
thereby, that their confessions are vaine and false. The other you
thinke may be doone, and see them confesse it, and therefore you
conclude, A posse ad esse ; as being persuaded it is so, bicause you
thinke it may be so. But I saie, both with the divines, and
philosophers, that that which is imagined of witchcraft, hath no truth
of action ; or being besides their imagination, the which (for the most
part) is occupied in false causes. For whosoever desireth to bring to
passe an impossible thing, hath a vaine, an idle, and a childish per-
suasion, bred by an unsound mind : for Sana vientis vobaitas,

A confutation of witches confessions, especiallie concerning their

league.

[UT it is objected, that witches confesse they renounce the
faith, and as their confession must be true (or else they
would not make it :) so must their fault be worthie of
\ death, or else they should not be executed. Whereunto
I answer as before ; that their confessions are extorted, or else pro-
ceed from an unsound mind. Yea I saie further, that we our selves,
which are sound of mind, and yet seeke anie other waie of salvation
than Christ Jesus, or breake his commandements, or walke not in
his steps with a livelie faith, &c : doo not onlie renounce the faith,
but God himselfe : and therefore they (in confessing that they forsake
God, and imbrace sathan) doo that which we all should doo. As
touching that horrible part of their confession, in the league which
tendeth to the killing of their owne and others children, the seething
of them, and the making of their potion or pottage, and the effects
thereof ; their good fridaies meeting, being the dale of their deliver-
ance, their incests, with their returne at the end of nine moneths^
when commonlie women be neither able to go that journie, nor ro
returne, &c ; it is so horrible, unnaturall, unlikelie, and unpossible ;
that if I should behold such things with mine eies, I should rather
thinke my selfe dreaming, dronken, or some waie deprived of my
senses ; than give credit to so horrible and filthie matters.

How hath the oile or pottage of a sodden child such vertue, as that
a staffe annointed therewith, can carrie folke in the aire.' Their
potable liquor, which (they saie) maketh maisters of that facultie, is it
not ridiculous 'i And is it not, by the opinion of all philosophers,

Their not fasting on fridaies, and their fasting on sundaies, their

A confutation of witches confessions^ conce7'ning vialcing of tempests

InD to speake more generallie of all the impossible actions
referred unto them, as also of their false confessions ; I
saie, that there is none which acknowledgeth God to be
onlie omnipotent, and the onlie worker of all miracles,
nor anie other indued with meane sense, but will denie that the

that they may at their pleasure send raine, haile, tempests, thunder,

for raine, &c. Whie father (quoth the child) I can make it raine 6i.

asked hir how hir mother taught hir? She answered, that hir mother

for hir. Whie then (said he) make it raine but onlie in my field. And
so she went to the streame, and threw up water in hir maisters name,
and made it raine presentlie. And proceeding further with hir father,
she made it haile ni another field, at hir fathers request. Hereupon
he accused his wife, and caused hir to be burned ; and then he new
christened his child againe : which circumstance is common among
papists and witchmongers. And howsoever the first part hereof was

Me thinks Seneca might satisfie these credulous or rather idolatrous
people, that runne a whorehunting, either in bodie or phansie, after
these witches, beleeving all that is attributed unto them, to the deroga-
tion of Gods glorie. He saith, that the rude people, and our ignorant
predecessors did beleeve, that raine and showers might be procured
and staled by witches charmes and inchantments : of which kind of
things that there can nothing be wrought, it is so manifest, that we need
not go to anie philosophers schoole, to learne the confutation thereof,

The xiiii. Chapter.




What would ens7ie, if witches confessiofis or iui\t'\chmongers opiiiions
ivere triie, coiiccrnitig the effects of witchcraft, inchantments, Ssr^c.

iF it were true that witches confesse, or that all writers
write, or that witchmongers report, or that fooles
belceve, we should never have butter in the chearne,
nor cow in the close, nor corne in the field, nor
faire weather abroad, nor health within doores. Or if that which
is conteined in M. Mai. Bodin, &c : or in the pamphlets late set
foorth in English, of witches executions, shuld be true in those
things that witches are said to confesse, what creature could live in
securitie 1 Or what needed such preparation of warres, or such trouble,
or charge in that behalfe .'' No prince should be able to reigne or live
in the land. For (as Danceus saith) that one Marline a witch killed
the emperour of Gennanie with witchcraft : so would our witches (if
they could) destroie all our magistrates. One old witch might over-
throwe an armie roiall : and then what needed we any guns, or wild
fire, or any other instruments of warre ? A witch might supplie all
wants, and accomplish a princes will in this behalfe, even without
charge or bloudshed of his people.

If it be objected, that witches worke by the divell, and christian
princes are not to deale that way ; I answer, that few princes disposed
to battell would make conscience therin, speciallie such as take unjust
wars in hand, using other helpes, devises, & engines as unlawful!
and divelish as that ; in whose campe there is neither the rule of
religion or christian order observed : insomuch as ravishments,
murthers, blasphemies and  thefts are there most commonlie and
freelie committed. So that the divell is more feared, and better
served in their camps, than God almightie.

But admit that souldiers would be scrupulous herein, the pope
hath authoritie to dispense therewith ; as in like case he hath  doone,
by the testimonie of his owne authors and friends. Admit also, that
throughout all christendome, warres were justly mainteined, and

religion dulie observed in their camps ; yet would the Turke
and other infidels cut our throtes, or at least one anothers throte,
with the helpe of their witches ; for they would make no conscience
thereof.

The XV. Chapter.

Examples of forrett tiations, tvho in their warres used the assist-
ance of witches; of eybiting witches in Irela7id, of two archers
that shot with familiars.

!!n the warres between the kings of Dejimarke and Sueve-
land, is6j. the Danes doo write, that the king of
Siievelattd caried about with him in his campe, foure
old witches, who with their charms so qualified the
they were thereby disabled to annoie their enimies :
insomuch as, if they had taken in hand anie enterprise, they were
so infeebled by those witches, as they could performe nothing.
And although this could have no credit at the first, yet in the end,
one of these witches was taken prisoner, and confessed the whole
matter ; so as (saith he) the thrtds, the line, and the characters were
found in the high waie and water plashes.

The Irishmen addict themselves wonderfullie to the credit and
practise hereof; insomuch as they affirme, that not onelie their children,
but their cattell, are (as they call it) eybitten, when they fall suddenlie
sicke, and terme one sort of their witches eybiters ; onelie in that
respect : yea and they will not sticke to affirme, that they can rime
either man or beast to death. Also the West hidians and Mttscovits
doo the like : and the Hunnes (as Gregorie Tttronctisis writeth) used
the helpe of witches in time of war.

I find another storie written in M. Mai. repeated by Bodin ; that
one souldier called Pumher, dailie through witchcraft killed with his
bowe and arrowes three of the enimies, as they stood peeping over
the walles of a castell besieged : so as in the end he killed them
all quite, saving one. The triall of the archers sinister  dealing,
and a proofe thereof expressed, is ; for that he never lightly failed
when he shot, and for that he killed them by three a dale ; and had
shot three arrowes into a rood. This was he that shot at a pennie on
his sonnes head, and made readie another arrow, to have slaine the
duke Remgrave that commanded it. And doubtlesse, bicause of his
singular dexteritie in shooting, he was reputed a witch, as dooing that
which others could not doo. nor thinke to be in the power of man to
doo : though indeed no miracle, no witchcraft, no impossibilitie nor
difficultie consisted therein.

But this latter storie I can requite with a famihar example. For at
Towne Mailing in kent, one of O. Maries justices, upon the com-
plaint of many wise men, and a few foolish boies, laid an archer by
the heeles ; bicause he shot so neere the white at buts. For he was
informed and persuaded, that the poore man plaied with a flie, other-
wise called a divell or familiar. And bicause he was certified that the
archer aforesaid shot belter than the common shooting, which he
before had heard of or scene, he conceived it could not be in Gods
name, but by inchantment : whereby this archer (as he supposed by
abusing the Oueenes liege people) gained some one daie two or three
shillings, to the detriment of the commonwealth, and to his owne
inriching. And therefore the archer was severelie punished, to the
great encom-agement of archers, and to the wise example of justice ;
but speciallie to the overthrowe of witchcraft. And now againe to
our matter.

condemned the confessions and erronious credulitie
of witches, to be vaine, fantasticall and fabulous.
And even those, which are parcell of their league,
whenipon our witchmongers doo so build, to wit ; their night
walkings and meetings with Herodias, and  the Pagatt gods : at
which time they should passe so farre in so little a space on cock-
horsse ; their transubstantiation, their eating of children, and their
pulling of them from their mothers sides, their entring into mens
houses, through chinks and little holes, where a flie can scarselie
wring out, and the disquieting of the inhabitants, &€: all which are
not onelie said by a generall councell to be meere fantasticall, and
imaginations in dreames ; but so affirmed by the ancient writers.
The words of the councell are these ; It may not be omitted, that
certeine wicked women following sathans provocations, being seduced
by the illusion of divels, beleeve and professe, that in the night times
they ride abroad with Diana, the goddesse of the Pagans, or else with
Herodias, with an innumerable multitude, upon certeine beasts, and
passe over manie countries and nations, in the silence of the night,
and doo whatsoever those fairies or ladies command, &c. And it
followeth even there ; Let all ministers therefore in their severall cures,
preach to Gods people, so as they may knowe all these things to be
false, &c. It followeth in the same councell; Therefore, whosoever

And if this be credible, then all these their bargaines and assem-
blies, &c : are incredible, which are onelie ratified by certeine foolish
and extorted confessions ; and by a fable of S. Germane., who
watched the fairies or witches, being at a reere banket, and through
his holinesse staled them, till he sent to the houses of those neigh-
bours, which seemed to be there, and found them all in bed ; and so
tried, that these were divels in the likenesse of those women. Which
if it were as true, as it is false, it might serve well to confute this
their meeting and night-walking. For if the divels be onlie present
in the likenesse of witches, then is that false, which is attributed to
witches in this behalfe.

But bicause the old hammar of Sprcnger and Institor, in their

old Malleo Alalejicarum, was insufficient to knocke downe this

councell ; a yoong beetle-head called Frier BariJioloviccns Spineus

hath made a new leaden beetle, to beate downe the councell, and

to kill these old women. Wherein he counterfeiting  Aesops asse,

claweth the pope with his heeles : affirming upon his credit, that the

councell is false and erronious ; bicause the doctrine swarveth from

the popish church, and is not authenticall but apocryphall ; saieng

(though untrulie) that that councell was not called by the commande-

ment and pleasure of the pope, nor ratified by his authoritie, which

(saith he) is sufficient to disanull all councels. For surelie (saith this

frier, which at this instant is a cheefe inquisitor) if the words of this

councell were to be admitted, both I, and all my predecessors had

published notorious lies, and committed manie injurious executions ;

whereby the popes themselves also might justlie be detected of error,

contrarie to the catholike beleefe in that behalfe. Alarrie he saith,

therfore, confuteth that opinion by a notable reason,

commonlie unlike to live one whole yeare ? The terror of hell
fire must needs be to them diverslie manifested, and much more
terrible ; bicause of their weaknesse, nature, and kind, than to any
other : as it would appeere, if a witch were but asked, Whether
she would be contented to be hanged one yeare hence, upon
condition hir displesure might be wreked upon hir enimie pre-
sentlie. As for theeves, & such other, they thinke not to go
to hell fire; but are either persuaded there is no hell, or that
their crime deserveth it not, or else that they have time enough
to repent : so as, no doubt, if they were perfectlie resolved heereof,
they would never make such adventures. Neither doo I thinke, that
for any summe of monie, they would make so direct a bargaine to go
to hell fire. Now then I conclude, that confession in this behalf is
insufficient to take awaie the life of any body ; or to atteine such
credit, as to be beleeved without further proofe. For as Augustine
and Isidore., with the rest of the sounder divines saie, that these
prestigious things, which are wrought by witches are fantasticall : so
doo the sounder decrees of councels and canons agree, that in that
case, there is no place for criminall action. And the lawe saith, that
The confession of such persons as are illuded, must needs be
erronious, and therefore is not to be admitted ; for, Confessio
debet tenere verum dr' possibile. But these things are opposite
both to lawe and nature, and therfore it followeth not; Bicause these
witches confesse so. Ergo it is so. For the confession ditfereth
from the act, or from the possibilitie of the act. And whatsoever is
contrarie to nature faileth in his principles, and therefore is naturallie
impossible.

The lawe also saith. In criminalibus regiilaritcr non statur
soli confessioni rei, In criminall cases or touching life, we must not
absolutelie stand to the confession of the accused partie : but in
these matters proofes must be brought more cleare than the light it
selfe. And in this crime no bodie must be condemned upon pre-
sumptions. And where it is objected and urged, that Since God
onelie knoweth the thoughts, therefore there is none other %vaie of
proofe but by confession : It is answered thus in the lawe, to wit:
Their confession in this case conteineth an outward act, and the same
impossible both in lawe and nature, and also unlikelie to be true ;
and therefore Quod verisiniile non est, attendi non debet. So
as, though their confessions may be worthie of punishment, as
whereby they shew a will to commit such mischeefe, yet not worthie
of credit, as that they have such power. For, Si factum absit,
soldque opinione laborent., e stultoruni genere sunt ; If they con-
fesse a fact performed but in opinion, they are to be reputed



of Witchcraft.

among the number of fooles. Neither may any man be by lawe con-
demned for criminall causes, upon presumptions, nor yet by single
witnesses : neither at the accusation of a capitall enimie, who indeed
is not to be admitted to give evidence in this case ; though it please 70,
M. Mai. and Bodin to affirme the contrarie. But beyond all equitie,
these inquisitors have shifts and devises enow, to plague and kill
these poore soules : for (they say) their fault is greatest of all others ;
bicause of their carnall copulation with the divell, and therefore they
are to be punished as heretikes, foure maner of waies : to wit ; with
excommunication, deprivation, losse of goods, and also with death.

And indeede they find lawe, and provide meanes thereby to
mainteine this their bloudie humor. For it is written in their popish
canons, that As for these kind of heretikes, how much soever they affirmed by
repent and returne to the faith, they may not be retemed alive, or kept
in perpetuall prison ; but be put to extreame death. Yea, M. Mai.
writeth, that A witches sinne is the sinne against the Holie-ghost ; to
wit, irremissible : yea further, that it is greater than the sinne of the
angels that fell. In which respect I wonder, that Moses delivered not
three tables to the children of Israeli ; or at the leastwise, that he ex-
hibited not commandements for it. It is not credible that the greatest
should be included in the lesse, (S:c.

But when these witchmongers are convinced in the objection
concerning their confessions ; so as thereby their tyrannicall argu-
ments cannot prevaile, to imbrue the magistrates hands in so much
bloud as their appetite requireth : they fall to accusing them of other
crimes, that the world might thinke they had some colour to
mainteine their malicious furie against them.

to us to be idolaters, as doo externall worship to idols

such as hope for and seeke salvation at  the hands of idols, or of 7^
anie other than God ; or fix their whole mind and love upon
anie creature, so as the power of God be neglected and con-
temned thereby. But witches neither seeke nor beleeve to have
salvation at the hands of divels, but by them they are onlie
deceived ; the instruments of their phantasie being corrupted, and

so infatuated, that they suppose, confesse, and saie they can doo
that, which is as farre beyond their power and nature to doo, as to
kill a man at Yorke before noone, when they have beene scene at
Lotidon in that morning, &c. But if these latter idolaters, whose
idolatrie is spirituall, and committed onelie in mind, should be
punished by death ; then should everie covetous man, or other, that
setteth his affection anie waie too much upon an earthlie creature, be

Apostasie, Sccondlic, apostasie is laid to their charge, whereby it is inferred,

that they are worthie to die. But apostasie is, where anie of sound

If The fourth Booke.

The first Chapter.

Of ivitcJanongers opinions coficernifig evill spirits, how they frame
themselves in more excellent sort than God made us.

AMES SPRENGER and Henrie Institor, in M. Mai.
agreing with Bodin, Earth. Spineus, Danaus, Eras-
tus, Hemingius, and the rest, doo make a bawdie
discourse ; labouring to proove by a fooHsh kind of
philosophie, that evill spirits cannot onlie take earthlie forms
and shapes of men ; but also counterfeit hearing, seeing, &c ; and
likewise, that they can eate and devoure meats, and also reteine,
digest, and avoid the same : and finalHe, use diverse kinds of activi-
ties, but speciallie excell in the use and art of venerie. For M. Mai.
saith, that The eies and eares of the mind are farre more subtill than
bodilie eies or carnall eares. Yea it is there affirmed, that as they
take bodies, and the likenesse of members ; so they take minds and
similitudes of their operations. But by the way, I would have them
answer this question. Our minds and soules are spirituall things. If
our corporall eares be stopped, what can they heare or conceive of
anie externall wisedome? And truelie, a man of such a constitution
of bodie, as they imagine of these spirits, which make themselves,
&c : were of farre more excellent substance, &c : than the bodies of
them that God made in paradise ; and so the divels workmanship
should exceed the handle worke of God the father and creator of all
things. 

The second Chapter.

Of bawdie Incubus and Siiccubus, and whether the action of
venerie may be performed bctweene witches and divels, and when
witches first yeelded to hicubus.

JERETOFORE (they saie) Incubus was faine to ravish
women against their will, untill Anno. 1400 : but now
since that time witches consent willinglie to their
desires : in so much as some one witch exerciseth

that trade of lecherie with Incubus twentie or thirtie yeares togither ;

as was confessed by fourtie and eight witches burned at Ravcnspurge.




of ]]'itcJicraft. chap. 2. 59

But what goodlie fellowes Incubus begetteth upon these witches,

is prooved by TJiouias of Aquine, Bodiu, M. Mai. Hypetius, in. scn.dist. ^.

^ art. 4.

This is prooved first by the divels cunning, in discerning the dif- Gen, 6, 4.
ference of the seed which falleth from men. Secondlie, by his under-
standing of the aptnes of the women for the receipt of such seed.
ThirdUe by his knowledge of the constellations, which are freendlie to
such corporall effects. And lastlie, by the excellent complexion of
such as the divell maketh choice of, to beget such notable personages
upon, as are the causes of the greatnesse and excellencie of the child 59.
thus begotten.

And to proove that such bawdie dooings betwixt the divell and Mai. maUf.
witches is not fained, S. Augustine is alledged, who saith, that All ^^!^-^;J"f; '
superstitious arts had their beginning of the pestiferous societie doctrina Chrht.
betwixt the divell and man. Wherein he saith truelie ; for that in
paradise, betwixt the divell and man, all wickednes was so contrived,
that man ever since hath studied wicked arts : yea and the divell will
be sure to be at the middle and at both ends of everie mischeefe.
But that the divell ingendreth with a woman, in maner and forme
as is supposed, and naturallie begetteth the wicked, neither is it true,
nor Augtistines meaning in this place.

Howbeit M. Mai. proceedeth, affirming that All witches take their 75.
beginning from such filthie actions, wherein the divell, in likenes of
a prettie wench, lieth prostitute as Succubics lo the man, and reteining
his nature and seede, conveieth it unto the witch, to whome he deli-
vereth it as Incubus. Wherein also is refuted the opinion of them
that hold a spirit to be unpalpable. M. Mai. saith, There can be nai male.
rendred no infallible rule, though a probable distinction may be set i"^- '•■'«'• '•
downe, whether Incubus in the act of venerie doo alwaies powre seed
out of his assumed bodie. And this is the distinction ; Either she is
old and barren, or yoong and pregnant. If she be barren, then dooth
Incubus use hir without decision of seed ; bicause such seed should
serve for no purpose. And the divell avoideth superfluitie as much
as he may ; and yet for hir pleasure and condemnation togither, he
goeth to worke with hir. But by the waie, if the divell were so com-
pendious, what should he need to use such circumstances, even in
these verie actions, as to make these assemblies, conventicles, cere-
monies, &c : when he hath alreadie bought their bodies, and bar-
gained for their soules ? Or what reason had he, to make them kill
so manie infants, by whom he rather loseth than gaineth any thing ;
bicause they are, so farre as either he or we knowe, in better case than
we of riper yeares by reason of their innocencie ? Well, if she be not
past children, then stealeth he seed awaie (as hath beene said) from

some wicked man being about that lecherous busines, and therewith
getteth yoong witches upon the old.

And note, that they affirme that this businesse is better accomplished
with seed thus gathered, than that which is shed in dremes, through
superfluitie of humors : bicause that is gathered from the vertue of the
seed generative. And if it be said that the seed will wax cold by the
waie, and so lose his natural! heate, and consequentlie the vertue :
M. Mai. DancEus, and the rest doo answere, that the divell can so
Carrie it, as no heate shall go from it, &c.

Furthermore, old witches are sworne to procure as manie yoong
virgins for Inciibus as they can, whereby in time they growe to be
excellent bawds : but in this case the preest plaieth Incubus. For
you shall find, that confession to a preest, and namelie this word
Befiedicite., driveth hicubus awaie, when Ave Maries, crosses, and all
other charmes faile.

60. yd. The third Chapter.

Of the divels visible fir* invisible dealitig with ivitches in the waie
of lecher ie.

lUT as touching the divels visible or invisible execution
of lecherie, it is written, that to such witches, as before
have made a visible legue with the preest, (the divell
I should saie) there is no necessitie that Incubus should
appeere invisible : marrie to the standers by hee is for the most
part invisible. For proofe hereof fames Sprenger and Institor
affirme, that Manie times witches are seene in the fields, and
woods, prostituting themselves uncovered and naked up to the navill,
wagging and mooving their members in everie part, according to the
disposition of one being about that act of concupiscence, and yet no-
thing seene of the beholders upon hir ; saving that after such a con-
venient time as is required about such a peece of worke, a blacke
vapor of the length and bignesse of a man, hath beene seene as it
were to depart from hir, and to ascend from that place. Neverthe-
Mal. Male. lesse, manie times the husband seeth Incubus making him cuckhold,
in the likenesse of a man, and sometimes striketh off his head with
his sword : but bicause the bodie is nothing but aire, it closelh
togither againe : so as, although the goodwife be some times hurt
thereby ; yet she maketh him beleeve he is mad or possessed, & that
he dooth he knoweth not what. For she hath more pleasure and
delight (they say) with Incubus that waie, than with anie mortall
man : whereby you may perceive that spirits are palpable. 




of Witchcraft. chap. 4. 61



The fourth Chapter. 77.

That the power ofgenefation is both outwardlie and inwardlie itn-
peached by witches, and of divers that had their genitals taken
from tJiem by witches, and by the same vieanes againe restored.

IJHEY also affirme, that the vertue of generation is
impeached by witches, both inwardHe, and outward-
lie : for intrinsecallie they represse the courage, and
LJS^ I they stop the passage of the mans seed, so as it may
not descend to the vessels of generation : also they hurt extrinse-
callie, with images, hearbs, &c. And to proove this true, you shall
heare certeine stories out of M. Mai. worthie to be noted.

A yoong priest at Mesptirge in the diocesse of Co7istance was be- Mai. Male.
witched, so as he had no power to occupie any other or mo women ^"A^^- ?'"*■■ ••
than one ; and to be delivered out of that thraldom, sought to flie into
another countrie, where he might use that preestlie occupation more
freelie. But all in vaine ; for evermore he was brought as far back-
ward by night, as he went forward in the daie before ; sometimes by
land, sometimes in the aire, as though he flew. And if this be not
true, I am sure that fames Sprenger dooth lie.

For the further confirmation of our beleefe in Incubtts, M. Mai.
citeth a storie of a notable matter executed at Ravensptirge, as true
and as cleanlie as the rest. A yoong man lieng with a wench in that 61.
towne (saith he) was faine to leave his instruments of venerie behind
him, by meanes of that prestigious art of witchcraft : so as in that
place nothing could be scene or felt but his plaine bodie. This yoong
man was willed by another witch, to go to hir whom he suspected,
and by faire or fowle meanes to require hir helpe : who soone after
meeting with hir, intreated hir faire, but that was in vaine ; and there-
fore he caught hir by the throte, and with a towell strangled hir,
saieng : Restore me my toole, or thou shalt die for it : so as she being yS.
swolne and blacke in the face, and through his boisterous handling
readie to die, said ; Let me go, and I will helpe thee. And whilest he
was loosing the towell, she put hir hand into his codpeece, and
touched the place ; saieng ; Now hast thou thy desire : and even at
that instant he felt himselfe restored.

Item, a reverend father, for his life, holinesse, and knowledge 7'2- Sfimger. in
notorious, being a frier of the order and companie of Spire, reported, far.2"qt^.i.
that a yoong man at shrift made lamentable moane unto him for the
like losse : but his gravitie suffered him not to beleeve lightlie any
such reports, and therefore made the yoong man untrusse his cod-
peece point, and sawe the complaint to be true and just. Whereupon

he advised or rather injoined the youth to go to the witch whome he
suspected, and with flattering words to intreat hir, to be so good unto
him, as to restore him his instrument : which by that meanes he ob-
teined, and soone after returned to shew himselfe thankfull ; and told
the holie father of his good successe in that behalfe : but he so be-
leeved him, as he would needs be Oailatits testis., and made him pull
downe his breeches, and so was satisfied of the troth and certeintie
thereof.

Another yoong man being in that verie taking, went to a witch for
the restitution thereof, who brought him to a tree, where she shewed
him a nest, and bad hint clime up and take it. And being in the top
of the tree, he tooke out a mightie great one, and shewed the same to
hir, asking hir if he might not have the same. Naie (cjuoth she)
that is our parish preests toole, but take anie other which thou wilt.
And it is there affirmed, that some have found 20. and some 30. of
them in one nest, being there preserved with provender, as it were
at the racke and manger, with this note, wherein there is no con-
tradiction (for all must be true that is written against witches) that
If a witch deprive one of his privities, it is done onlie by prestigious
meanes, so as the senses are but illuded. Marie by the divell it is
reallie taken awaie, and in like sort restored. These are no jestes, for
they be written by them that were and are judges upon the lives and
deaths of those persons.

The seventh Chapter.

Of divers saincts and holie persons, which 'we?-e exceeding bawdie
and lecherous, and by cerieitie miraculous weaties becatne chaste.

ASSIANUS writeth, that S. Syren being of bodie verie

lecherous, and of mind woonderfull religious, fasted and

praied ; to the end his bodie might be reduced miracu-

louslie to chastitie. At length came an angell unto him

by night, and cut out of his flesh certeine kernels, which were the

sparkes of concupiscence ; so as afterwards he never had anie more

motions of the flesh. It is also reported, that the abbat Eqiiicius

being naturallie as unchast as the other, fell to his beads so devoutlie

for recoverie of honestie, that there came an angell unto him in an

apparition, that seemed to geld him ; and after that (forsooth) he

was as chaste as though he had had never a stone in his breech ; and

before that time being a ruler over monkes, he became afterwards a

governour over nunnes. Even as it is said Helias the holie monke

gathered thirtie virgins into a monasterie, over whom he ruled and

reigned by the space of two yeares, and grew so proud and hot in the

codpeece, that he was faine to forsake his holie house, and flie to a

desert, where he fasted and praied two daies, saieng ; Lord quench

my hot lecherous humors, or kill me. Whereupon in the night

following, there came unto him three angels, and demanded of him

why he forsooke his charge : but the holie man was ashamed to tell

them. Howbeit they asked him further, saieng ; Wilt thou returne

to these damsels, if we free thee from all concupiscence ? Yea (quoth

he) with all my heart. And when they had sworne him solemnelie so

to doo, they tooke him up, & gelded him ; and one of them holding

his hands, and another his feete, the third cut out his stones. But the

storie saith it was not so ended, but in a vision. Which I beleeve,

A strange cure doone to one that was molested with Incubiis.

OW being wearied with the rehearsall of so mania

lecheries most horrible, and very filthie and fabulous

actions and passions of witches, together with the spirit

Inaibus, I will end with a true storie taken out of Jason

Pratensis, which though it be rude, yet is it not altogither so

uncleane as the rest.

There came (saith he) of late a masse priest unto me, making
pitious moane, and saieng, that if I holpt him not, he should be
undoone, and utterlie overthrowne ; so great was his infirmitie : for
(saith he) I was woont to be faire and fat, and of an excellent com-
plexion ; and lo how I looke, being now a verie ghost consisting of
skinne and bone, &c. What is the matter (quoth Jason ?) I will
shew you sir, said the priest. There commeth unto mee, almost
everie night, a certeine woman, unknowne unto me, and lieth so
heavie upon my brest, that I cannot fetch rny breath, neither have
anie power to crie, neither doo my hands serve me to shoove hir
awaie, nor my feete to go from hir. I smiled {(]}xo\\\ Jasoii) and told
him that he was vexed with a disease called In\ciibns, or the mare ;
and the residue was phantasie and vaine imagination. Naie (said
the priest) it cannot be so: for by our blessed ladie, I tell you
nothing but that with waking I saw with mine eies, "and felt with
mine hands. I see hir when she commeth upon me, and strive to
repell hir; but I am so infeebled that I cannot: and for remedie I
have runne about from place to place, but no helpe that I could get.
At length I went to an old frier that was counted an od fellow ; arid
thought to have had help at his hands, but the divell a whit had I of
him ; saving that for remedie he willed me to praie to God ; whome I
am sure I wearied with my tedious praiers long before. Then went I
unto an old woman (quoth the priest) who was said to be a cunning
witch : and she willed me, that the next morning, about the dawning
of the daie, I should pisse, and immediatlie should cover the pispot,
or stop it with my right netherstocke, and before night the witch
should come to visit me. And although (quoth he) the respect of
mine orders somewhat terrified me from the execution of hir advise;
yet my necessities diverse waies, and speciallie my paines moved
me to make triall of hir words. And by the masse (quoth the priest)
hir prophesie fell out as sure as a club. For a witch came to my
house, and complained of a greefe in hir bladder, and that she could
not pisse. But I could neither by faire nor fowle meanes obteine at

hir hands, that she would leave molesting me by night; but she
keepeth hir old custome, determining by these filthie meanes to
dispatch me. I could hardlie (saith Jason) reclaime him from this The priest

times, he began to comfort himselfe, and at last perceiving it, he
acknowledged his disease, and recovered the same.

The tenth Chapter. ^^^^

A confutation of all the former follies touching Incubus, which
by examples and proof es of like stuffe is shewed to be flat knaverie,
zi'herein the carnall coptilation with spirits is overthrowtie.

IHUS are lecheries covered with the cloke of Incubus
and witchcraft, contrarie to nature and veritie : and
with these fables is mainteined an opinion, that men have
beene begotten without carnall copulation (as Hyperiics
and others write that Merlin was, An. 440.) speciallie to excuse and
mainteine the knaveries and lecheries of idle priests and bawdie
monkes ; and to cover the shame of their lovers and concubines.

And alas, when great learned men have beene so abused, with the
imagination of Incubus his carnall societie with women, miscon-
struing the scriptures, to wit, the place in Genesis 6. to the seducing
of manie others ; it is the lesse woonder, that this error hath passed so
generallie among the common people. 66.

But to use few words herein, I hope you understand that they
affirme and saie, that Incubus is a spirit ; and I trust you know that a
spirit hath no flesh nor bones, &c: and that he neither dooth eate
nor drinke. In deede your grandams maides were woont to set aboil
of milke before him and his cousine Robin good-fellow, for grinding
of malt or mustard, and sweeping the house at midnight : and you
have also heard that he would chafe exceedingly, if the maid or
good-wife of the house, having compassion of his nakednes, laid anie
clothes for him, beesides his messe of white bread and milke, which
was his standing fee. For in that case he saith ; What have
we here .-' Hemton hamten, here will I never more tread nor
stampen.

But to proceed in this confutation. Where there is no meate eaten, Q"hi humor
there can be no seed which thereof is ingendred : although it be ^ "'"" -"^"^ '-^
granted, that Robin could both eate and drinke, as being a cousening
idle frier, or some such roge, that wanted nothing either belonging to
lecherie or knaverie, &c. Item, where the genitall members want,
there can be no lust of the flesh : neither dooth nature give anie desire
of generation, where there is no propagation or succession recjuired.

And as spirits cannot be greeved with hunger, so can they not be

succession or heires ? For that is but an ordinance of God, to supplie
the place, the number, the world, the time, and speciallie to ac-

in members, but chieflie of vitall spirits, and of the hart : which
spirits are never in such a bodie as hictibus hath, being but a bodie

|UT in truth, this Incubus is a bodilie disease (as hath
beene said) although it extend unto the trouble of the
mind: which of some is called The mare, oppressing
manie in their sleepe so sore, as they are not able to
call for helpe, or stir themselves under the burthen of that heavie

the cruditie and rawnesse in the stomach : which ascending up
into the head oppresseth the braine, in so much as manie are much
infeebled therebie, as being nightlie haunted therewith. They
are most troubled with this disease, that being subject thereunto,
lie right upward : so as, to turne and lie on the one side, is present

unto him, so as he wake him, he is presentlie releeved. Howbeit,
there are magicall cures for it, as for example.

notable, and better than any charme for this purpose. There are also
other verses and charmes for this disease devised, which is the
common cloke for the ignorance of bad physicians. But Leonard
Fuchsius in his first booke, and 31. chapter, dooth not onelie describe
this disease, and the causes of it ; but also setteth downe verie
learnedlie the cure thereof, to the utter confusion of the witchmongers
follie in this behalfe. Hyperms being much bewitched and blinded
in this matter of witchcraft, hoovering about the interpretation of
Genesis 6. from whence the opinion of Inaebits and Siiccitbus
is extorted, Viderunt filii Dei filias hominufu, quod elegantes
essent, acceperiint sibi in nxores ex omnibus^ quas elegeraut, &=€ :
seemeth to mainteine upon heare-saie, that absurd opinion ; and
yet in the end is driven to conclude thus, to wit : Of the evill
spirits Incubus and Succubus there can be no firme reason or
proofe brought out of scriptures, using these verie words ;
Hcec ut probabilia dicta su7ito, quandoquident scripturarutn prcB-
sidio hac in causa destituimur. As if he should saie. Take this
as spoken probablie ; to wit, by humane reason, bicause we are
destitute of scriptures to mainteine the goodnesse of the cause.

Tertullian and Sulpicius Severus doo interpret Filios Dei in that
place to be angels, or evill spirits, and to have beene enamored with
the beautie of those wenches ; and finallie, begat giants by  them.
Which is throughlie confuted by Chrysostonie, Horn. 22. in Gen : but
speciallie by the circumstance of the text.

The first Chapter.

Of traiisformatio7is, ridiculous examples bj-ottght by the adver-
saries for the confirmation of their foolish doctrine.

|0W that I may with the verie absurdities, conteined
in their owne authors, and even in their principall
doctors and last writers, confound them that main-
teine the transubstantiations of witches ; I will shew
you certeine proper stuffe, which Bodin (their cheefe champion of J- ^°'^- ^'*- ^■
this age) hath gathered out of AI. Mai. and others, whereby he cap, 6.
laboureth to establish this impossible, incredible, and supernaturall,
or rather unnaturall doctrine of transubstantiation.

First, as touching the divell {Rodin saith) that he dooth most J- Bodin

,. -, ,. , , i_' ir • i J r ■ abuseth scripture

sounding to anie such purpose. Howbeit, he sometimes alloweth
the divell the shape of a blacke Moore, and as he saith he used to
appeare to Maivd Cruse, Kate Darey, and fane Harviller. But I
mervell, whether the divell createth himselfe, when he appeareth in
the likenesse of a man ; or whether God createth him, when the
divell wisheth it. As for witches, he saith they speciallie transub-
stantiate themselves into wolves, and them whom they bewitch into
asses : though else-where he differ somewhat herein  from himselfe. go.
But though he afifirme, that it may be naturallie brought to passe, Pudendis tunc
that a girle shall become a boie ; and that anie female may be turned pentil'us^.'''""'
into the male : yet he saith the same hath no afifinitie with Lycan-
thropia ; wherein he saith also, that men are wholie transformed, and
citeth infinite examples hereof.

First, that one Garner in the shape of a woolfe killed a girle of the
age of twelve yeares, and did eat up hir armes and legges, and carried
the rest home to his wife. Item, that Peter Bur get, and Michael
Werdon, having turned themselves with an ointment into woolves,
killed, and finallie did eate up an infinite number of people. Which
lie Wierus dooth sufficientlie confute. But until! you see and read jo. ivier. Ub. 6.

former shape of a man, was found in his bed, with the arrowe in his
thigh, which the archer that shot it knew verie well. Item, that
another being Lycanthropus in the forme of a woolfe, had his woolves
feet cut off, and in a moment he became a man without hands or
feete.

He accuseth also one of the mightiest princes in christendome,
even of late daies, to be one of those kind of witches (so as he could,
when he list, turne himselfe to a woolfe) affirming that he was espied
and oftentimes scene to performe that villanie ; bicause he would be
counted the king of all witches. He saith that this transubstantiation
is most common in Greece ^l and through out all Asia^ as merchant
strangers have reported to him. For Anno Doinini. 1542, when
Sultan Soliinon reigned, there was such force and multitude of
these kind of woolves in Constantinople^ that the emperour drave
togither in one flocke 150. of them, which departed out of the citie in
the presence of all the people.

To persuade us the more throughlie heerein, he saith, that in
Livonia, yearelie (about the end of December) a certeine knave or
divell warneth all the witches in the countrie to come to a certeine
place : if they faile, the divell commeth and whippeth them with an
iron rod ; so as the print of his lashes remaine upon their bodies for
ever. The capteine witch leadeth the waie through a great poole of
water : manie millians of witches swim after. They are no 'sooner
passed through that water, but they are all transformed into woolves,
and flie upon and devoure both men, women, cattell, &c. After twelve
daies they returne through the same water, and so receive humane
shape againe.

Item, that there was one Bajaniis a. Jew, being the sonne of Simeon,
which could, when he list, turne himselfe into a woolfe ; and by that
meanes could escape the force and danger of a whole armie of men.
Which thing (saith Bodin) is woonderfull: but yet (saith he) it is much
more marvelous, that men will not beleeve it. For manie poets
affirme it ; yea, and if you looke well into the matter (saith he) you
shall find it easie to doo. Item, he saith, that as naturall woolves per-
secute beasts; so doo these magicall woolves devoure men, women, and
children. And yet God saith to the people (I trowe) and not to the
cattell of Israeli ; If you observe not my commandements, I will send
among you the beasts of the feeld, which shall devoure both you and
your cattell. Item, I will send the teeth of beasts upon you. Where is
Bodins distinction now become ? He never saith, I will send witches
in the likenes of wolves, &c : to devoure you or your cattell.
Nevertheles, Bodin saith it is a cleare case : for the matter was dis-
puted upon before pope Leo the seventh, and by him all these matters

were judged possible : and at that time (saith he) were the transforma-
tions of Ltician and Apideius made canonicall.

Furthermore he saith, that through this art they are so cunning that
no man can apprehend them, but when they are a sleepe. Item, he
nameth another witch, that (as M. Mai. saith) could not be caught,
bicause he would transforme himselfe into a mouse, and runne into
everie little hole, till at length he was killed comming out of the hole of
a jamme in a windowe : which indeed is as possible, as a camell to go
through a needels eie. Item, he saith, that diverse witches at Vernon
turned themselves into cats, and both committed and received much
hurt. But at Argentine there was a wonderfull matter done, by three
witches of great wealth, who transforming themselves into three cats,
assalted a faggot-maker : who having hurt them all with a faggot
sticke, was like to have beene put to death. But he was miraculouslie
delivered, and they worthilie punished ; as the storie saith, from
whence Bodin had it.

After a great manie other such beastlie fables, he inveieth against
such physicians, as saie that Lycanthropia is a disease, and not a
transformation. Item, he mainteineth, as sacred and true, all Homers
fables of Circes and Ulyffes his companions : inveieng against Cliry-
sosionie, who rightlie interpreteth *omers meaning to be, that Ulyffes
his people were by the harlot Circes made in their brutish maners to
resemble swine.

But least some poets fables might be thought lies (whereby the
witchmongers arguments should quaile) he mainteineth for true the
most part of Ovids Metamorphosis., and the greatest absurdities and
impossibilities in all that booke : marie he thinketh some one tale
therein may be fained. Finallie, he confirmeth all these toies by the
storie of Nabuchadnez-znr. And bicause (saith he) Nabuchadnes-sar
continued seven yeres in the shape of a beast, therefore may witches
remaine so long in the forme of a beast ; having in all the meane
time, the shape, haire, voice, strength, agilitie, swiftnes, food and
excrements of beasts, and yet reserve the minds and soules of
women or men. Howbeit, S. Aiigtestitte (whether to confute or con-
firme that opinion judge you) saith ; Nan est credendum, hianamtm
corpus dcBVionum arte vel potestate in bestialia lineamenta
converti posse : We may not beleeve that a mans bodie may be
altered into the lineaments of a beast by the divels art or power.
Item, Bodin saith, that the reason whie witches are most commonlie
turned into woolves, is ; bicause they usuallie eate children, as
woolves eate cattell. Item, that the cause whie other are truelie
turned into asses, is ; for that such have beene desirous to understand
the secrets of witches. Whie witches are turned into cats, he

alledgeth no reason, and therefore (to helpe him foorth with that
paraphrase) I saie, that witches are curst queanes, and manie times
scratch one another, or their neighbours by the faces ; and therefore
perchance are turned into cats. But I have put twentie of these
witchmongers to silence with this one question ; to wit. Whether a
witch that can turne a woman into a cat, &c : can also turne a cat
into a woman ?

The second Chapter.

Absurd reasons brought by Bodin., and stcch others, for confirmation
of transfortiiations.

HESE Examples and reasons might put us in doubt, that
everie asse, woolfe, or cat that we see, were a man, a
woman, or a child. I marvel! that no man useth this
distinction in the definition of a man. But to what end
should one dispute against these creations, and recreations ; when
Bodifi washeth away all our arguments with one word, confessing that
none can create any thing but God ; acknowledging also the force of
the canons, and imbracing the opinions of such divines, as write
against him in this behalfe ? Yea he dooth now (contrarie to him-
selfe elsewhere) afifirme, that the divell cannot alter his forme. And
lo, this is his distinction, Non essentialis forma {id est ratio) sedfigura
solitm penmitatnr : The essential! forme (to wit, reason) is not
changed, but the shape or figure. And thereby he prooveth it easie
enough to create men or beasts with life, so as they remaine without
reason. Howbeit, I thinke it is an easier matter, to turne Bodins
reason into the reason of an asse, than his bodie into the shape of a
sheepe : which he saith is an easie matter ; bicause Lots  wife was
turned into a stone by the divell. Whereby he sheweth his grosse
ignorance. As though God that commanded Zf upon paine of death
not to looke backe, who also destroied the citie of Sodome at that
instant, had not also turned hir into a salt stone. And as though
all this while God had beene the divels drudge, to go about this
businesse all the night before, and when a miracle should be wrought,
the divell must be faine to doo it himselfe.

Item, he affirmeth, that these kind of transfigurations are more
common with them in the west parts of the world, than with us here
in the east. Howbeit, this note is given withall ; that that is ment of
the second persons, and not of the first : to wit, of the bewitched, and
not of the witches. For they can transforme themselves in everie
part of the world, whether it be east, west, north, or south. Marrie he
saith, that spirits and divels vex men most in the north countries, as

Indta : but among the heathen speciaUie, and wheresoever Christ is
not preached. And that is true, though not in so foolish, grosse, and
corporall a sense as Bodz'n taketh it. One notable instance of a
witches cunning in this behalfe touched by Bodin in the chapter
aforesaid, I thought good in this place to repeat : he taketh it out of
M. Mai. which tale was delivered to Sprenger by a knight of the
Rhods, being of the order of S. Jones at Jertisaiem ; and it followeth
thus.

The third Chapter.

Of a man turned into an asse, and returned againe into a man by
one 0 Bodins witches : S. Augustines opi7iio7i thereof.

T happened in the city of Salamin., in the kingdome of
Cyp7-us (wherein is a good haven) that a ship loaden with
merchandize staled there for a short space. In the meane
time many of the souldiers and mariners went to shoare,
to provide fresh victuals. Among which number, a certaine English
man, being a sturdie yoong fellowe, went to a womans house, a little
waie out of the citie, and not farre from the sea side, to see whether
she had anie egs to sell. Who perceiving him to be a lustie yoong
fellowe, a stranger, and farre from his countrie (so as upon the losse
of him there would be the lesse misse or inquirie) she considered
with hir selfe how to destroie him ; and willed him to stale there
awhile, whilest she went to fetch a few egs for him. But she tarried
long, so as the yoong man called unto hir, desiring hir to make hast :
for he told hir that the tide would be spent, and by that meanes his
ship would be gone, and leave him behind. Howbeit, after some
detracting of time, she brought him a few egs, willing him to returne to
hir, if his ship were gone when he came. The young fellowe returned
towards his ship : but before he went aboord, hee would needs eate
an eg or twaine to satisfie his hunger, and within short space he

I should terme him) being many times repelled, and understanding
their words that called him asse, considering that he could speake
never a word, and yet could understand everie bodie ; he thought
that he was bewitched by the woman, at whose house he was. And

words of his owne fellowes that called him asse, and returned to the
witches house, in whose service hee remained by the space of three
yeares, dooing nothing with his hands all that while, but carried such
burthens as she laied on his backe ; having onelie this comfort, that
although he were reputed an asse among strangers and beasts, yet
that both this witch, and all other witches knew him to be a man.

After three yeares were passed over, in a morning betimes he went

to towne before his dame ; who upon some occasion (of like to make

water) staied a little behind. In the meane time being neere to a

morrowe masse, and not daring to go into the church, least he should
have beene beaten and driven out with cudgels, in great devotion he
fell downe in the churchyard, upon the knees of his hinder legs, and
did lift his forefeet over his head, as the preest doth hold the sacra-
ment at the elevation. Which prodigious sight when certeine
merchants of Genua espied, and with woonder beheld ; anon commeth
the witch with a cudgell in hir hand, beating foorth the asse. And
bicause (as it hath beene said) such kinds of witchcrafts are verie
usuall in those parts ; the merchants aforesaid made such meanes, as
both the asse and the witch were attached by the judge. And she
being examined and set upon the racke, confessed the whole matter,
and promised, that if she might have libertie to go home, she would

hir: and the yoong man returned into his countrie with a joifull and

am content to beleeve. Howbeit S. Augiistin concludeth against
Bodin. For he affirmeth these transubstantiations to be but fantas-
tical!, and that they are not according to the veritie, but according to
the appearance. And yet I cannot allow of such appearances made
by witches, or yet by divels : for I find no such power given by God
to any creature. And I would wit of S. Augustine, where they be-
came, whom Bodins transformed woolves devoured. But

But where was the yoong mans ovvne shape all these three yeares,
wherein he was made an asse .'' It is a certeine and a general! rule,
that two substantial! formes cannot be in one subject Simul &^ seinel,
both at once: which is confessed by themselves. The forme of the
beast occupied some place in the aire, and so I thinke should the
forme of a man doo also. For to bring the bodie of a man, without
feeling, into such a thin airie nature, as that it can neither be seene
nor felt, it may well be unlikelie, but it is verie impossible: for the
aire is inconstant, and continueth not in one place. So as this airie
creature would soone be carried into another region: as else-where I
have largelie prooved. But indeed our bodies are visible, sensitive,
and passive, and are indued with manie other excellent properties,
which all the divels in hell are not able to alter: neither can one haire
of our head perish, or fall awaie, or be transformed, without the
speciall providence of God almightie.

But to proceed unto the probabilitie of this storie. What lucke was
it, that this yoong fellow of Etigland, landing so latelie in those parts,
and that old woman of Cyprus, being both of so base a condition,
should both understand one anothers communication; Englaiid and
Cyprus being so manie hundred miles distant, and their languages so
farre differing ? I am sure in these daies, wherein trafificke is more
used, and learning in more price; few yong or old mariners in this
realme can either speake or understand the language spoken at
Salamin in Cyprus, which is a kind of Grecke; and as few old women
there can speake our language. But BodinwiW saie; You heare, that
at the inquisitors commandement, and through the tormentors correc-
tion, she promised to restore him to his owne shape: and so she did,
as being thereunto compelled. I answer, that as the whole storie is
an impious fable; so this assertion is false, and disagreeable to their
owne doctrine, which mainteineth, that the witch dooth nothing but
by the permission and leave of God. For if she could doo or undoo
such a thing at hir owne pleasure, or at the commandement of the
inquisitors, or for feare of the tormentors, or for love of the partie, or
for remorse of conscience: then is it not either by the extraordinarie
leave, nor yet by the like direction of God; except you will make him
a confederate with old witches. I for my part woonder most, how
they can turne and tosse a mans bodie so, and make it smaller and
greater, to wit, like a mowse, or like an asse, &c: and the man all this
while to feele no paine. And I am not alone in this maze: for
DancEtts a special mainteiner of their follies saith, that although
Augustine and Apuleius doo write verie crediblie of these matters ;
yet will he never beleeve, that witches can change men into other
formes ; as asses, apes, woolves, beares, mice, &c.




of Witchc7'aft, chap. 5. 79



The fift Chapter.

That the bodie of a man cannot be turned into the bodie of a beast by
a witch, is grooved by strong reasons, scriptures, attd authorities.

|UT was this man an asse all this while? Or was this
asse a man ? Bodin saith (his reason onelie reserved) he
was trulie transubstantiated into an asse ; so as there
must be no part of a man, but reason remaining in this
asse. And yet Hermes Trisinegistus \}cv\vik^'Ci\ he hath good authoritie Hermes Ttisme

other than an humane bodie, nor yet canne light into a bodie that
wanteth reason of mind. But S.yaw^fJ saith; the bodie without the Jam. 3, 26.
spirit is dead. And surelie, when the soule is departed from the
bodie, the life of man is dissolved: and therefore Patde wished to be Phiii. i, 23.
dissolved, when he would have beene with Christ. The bodie of man
is subject to divers kinds of agues, sicknesses, and infirmities, where-
unto an asses bodie is not inclined: and mans bodie must be fed with
bread, &c : and not with hay. Bodiiis asseheaded man must either
eate haie, or nothing: as appeareth in the storie. Mans bodie also is
subject unto death, and hath his dales numbred. If this fellowe had
died in the meane time, as his houre might have beene come, for anie
thing the divels, the witch, or Bodin knew; I mervell then what would
have become of this asse, or how the witch could have restored him
to shape, or whether he should have risen at the dale of judgement in
an asses bodie and shape. For Paule saith, that that verie bodie iCor. 15. 44.
which is sowne and buried a naturall bodie, is raised a spirituall bodie. 100.
The life of Jesus is made manifest in our mortall flesh, and not in the
flesh of an asse.

God hath endued everie man and everie thing with his proper
nature, substance, forme, qualities, and gifts, and directeth their
waies. As for the waies of an asse, he taketh no such care : howbeit,
they have also their properties and substance severall to themselves.
For there is one flesh (saith Paule) of men, another flesh of beasts, i. Cor. 15, 39.
another of fishes, another of birds. And therefore it is absolutelie
against the ordinance of God (who hath made me a man) that I should
flie like a bird, or swim like a fish, or creepe like a worme, or become
an asse in shape: insomuch as if God would give me leave, I cannot
doo it; for it were contrarie to his ovvne order and decree, and to the
constitution of anie bodie which he hath made. Yea the spirits them- Psal. 119.

selves have their lawes and limits prescribed, beyond the which they
cannot passe one haires breadth; otherwise God should be contrarie
to himselfe: which is farre from him. Neither is Gods omnipotencie
hereby qualified, but the divels impotencie manifested, who hath none
other power, but that which God from the beginning hath appointed
unto him, consonant to his nature and substance. He may well be
restreined from his power and will, but beyond the same he cannot
passe, as being Gods minister, no further but in that which he hath
from the beginning enabled him to doo: which is, that he being a
spirit, may with Gods leave and ordinance viciat and corrupt the spirit
and will of man : wherein he is verie diligent.

What a beastlie assertion is it, that a man, whom GOD hath made
according to his owne similitude and likenes, should be by a witch
turned into a beast .? What an impietie is it to affirme, that an asses
bodie is the temple of the Holy-ghost.'' Or anasseto be the child of
God, and God to be his father ; as it is said of man ? Which Paule
to the Corinthiatis so divinelie confuteth, who saith, that Our bodies
are the members of Christ. In the which we are to glorifie God: for
the bodie is for the Lord, and the Lord is for the bodie. Surelie he
meaneth not for an asses bodie, as by this time I hope appeareth: in
such wise as Bodin may go hide him for  shame; especiallie when he
shall understand, that even into these our bodies, which God hath
framed after his owne likenesse, he hath also brethed that spirit, which
Bodm saith is now remaining within an asses bodie, which God hath
so subjected in such servilitie under the foote of man; Of whom God is
so mindfull, that he hath made him little lower than angels, yea than
himselfe, and crowned him with glorie and worship, and made him to
have dominion over the workes of his hands, as having put all things
under his feete, all sheepe and oxen, yea woolves, asses, and all other
beasts of the field, the foules of the aire, the fishes of the sea, &c.
Bodins poet, Ovid, whose MetamorpJiosis make so much for him,
saith to the overthrow of this phantasticall imagination :
Os homini sublime dedif, cceh'imque vide re
Jnssit, &= erectos ad sydera tollere vultus.
The effect of which verses is this ;
* The Lord did set mans face so hie,
That he the heavens might behold,
And looke tip to the starrie skie.
To see his woo7iders manifold.

Now, if a witch or a divell can so alter the shape of a man, as con-
trarilie to make him looke downe to hell, like a beast ; Gods works
should not onelie be defaced and disgraced, but his ordinance should
be woonderfullie altered, and thereby confounded.

The sixt Chapter.

The witchmoiigers objections, concerning Nabuchadnes-zar an-
swered, a7id their errour concei'uing Lycanthro-pia confuted.

ALLEUS MALEFICARUM, Bodin, and manie other of
them that mainteine witchcraft, triumph upon the storie of
Nabuchadttes-sar ; as though Circes had transformed him
with hir sorceries into an oxe, as she did others into
swine, (ic. I answer, that he was neither in bodie nor shape trans-
formed at all, according to their grosse imagination ; as appeareth
both by the plaine words of the text, and also by the opinions of the
best interpretors thereof : but that he was, for his beastlie government
and conditions, throwne out of his kingdome and banished for a
time, and driven to hide himselfe in the wildernesse, there in exile to
lead his life in beastlie sort, among beasts of the field, and fowles of
the aire (for by the waie I tell you it appeareth by the text, that he
was rather turned into the shape of a fowle than of a beast) untill he
rejecting his beastlie conditions, was upon his repentance and amend-
ment called home, and restored unto his kingdome. Howbeit, this
(by their confession) was neither divels nor witches dooing ; but a
miracle wrought by God, whom alone I acknowledge to be able to
bring to passe such workes at his pleasure. Wherein I would know
what our witchmongers have gained.

I am not ignorant that some write, that after the death of Nabuchad-
nez-sar, his sonne *Eilnmorodath gave his bodie to the ravens to be
devoured, least afterwards his father should arise from death, who of
a beast became a man againe. But this tale is meeter to have place
in the Cabalisticall art, to wit : among unwritten verities than here.
To conclude, I saie that the transformations, which these witch-
mongers doo so rave and rage upon, is (as all the learned sort of
physicians afifirme) a disease proceeding partlie from melancholie,
wherebie manie suppose themselves to be woolves, or such ravening
beasts. For Lycanthropia is of the ancient physicians called Liipina
melancholia, or Lnpina insania. J. Wierus declareth verie learnedlie,
the cause, the circumstance, and the cure of this disease. I have
written the more herein ; bicause hereby great princes and
potentates, as well as poore women and innocents,
have beene defamed and accounted
among the number
of witches.

The seventh Chapter.

A speciall objection answered concernitig tra7isportations, with the
consent of diverse writers thereupon.

I OR the maintenarice of witches transportations, they
object the words of the Gospell, where the divell is said to
take up Christ, and t© set him on a pinnacle of the
temple, and on a mountaine, &c. Which if he had doone
in maner and forme as they suppose, it followeth not therefore that
witches could doo the like ; nor yet that the divell would doo it for
them at their pleasure ; for they know not their thoughts, neither can
otherwise communicate with them. But I answer, that if it were so
grosselie to be understood, as they imagine it, yet should it make
nothing to their purpose. For I hope they will not saie, that Christ
had made anie ointments, or entred into anie league with the divell,
and by vertue thereof was transported from out of the wildernes, unto
the top of the temple of Jerusaiem ; or that the divell could have
maisteries over his bodie, whose soule he could never laie hold upon ;
especiallie when he might (with a becke of his finger) have called unto
him, and have had the assistance of manie legions of angels. Neither
(as I thinke) will they presume to make Christ partaker of the divels
purpose and sinne in that behalfe. If they saie ; This was an action
wrought by the speciall providence of God, and by his appointment,
that the scripture might be fulfilled : then what gaine our witch-
mongers by this place ? First, for that they maie not produce a par-
ticular example to prove so generall an argument. And againe, if it
were by Gods speciall providence and appointment ; then why should
it not be doone by the hand of God, as it was in the storie of Job ?
Or if it were Gods speciall purpose and pleasure, that there should be
so extraordinarie a matter brought to passe by the hand of the divell;
could not God have given to the wicked angell extraordinarie power,
and cloathed him with extraordinarie shape ; whereby he might be
made an instrument able to accomplish that matter, as he did to his
angell that carried Abacuck to Dmiiell, and to them that he sent to
destroie Sodome ? But you shall understand, that  this was doone in
a vision, and not in veritie of action. So as they have a verie cold
pull of this place, which is the speciall peece of scripture alledged of
them for their transportations.

Heare therefore what Calvine saith in his commentarie upon that
place, in these words ; The question is, whether Christ were carried
aloft indeed, or whether it were but in a vision .'' Manie affirme verie



of Witchcraft. chap.7. 83

obstinatlie, that his bodie was trulie and realHe as they saie taken
up : bicause they thinke it too great an indignitie for Christ to be
made subject to sathans ilkisions. But this objection is easihe washed
avvaie. For it is no absurditie to grant all this to be wrought through
Gods permission, or Christes voluntarie subjection : so long as we
yeeld not to thinke that he suffered these temptations inwardlie, that
is to saie, in mind or soule. And that which is afterwards set downe
by the Evangelist, where the divell shewed him all the kingdoms of
the world, and the glorie of the same, and that to be doone (as it is
said in Luke) in the twinkling of an eie, dooth more agree with a
vision than with a reall action. So farre are the verie words of
Calvhie. Which differ not one syllable nor five words from that
which I had written herein, before I looked for his opinion in the
matter. And this I hope will be sufficient to overthrow the assertions
of them that laie the ground of their transportations and flieng in the
aire hereupon.

He that will saie, that these words ; to wit, that Christ was taken
up, &c : can hardlie be applied to a vision, let him turne to the
prophesie oi EzecJiicIl, and see the selfe-same words used in a vision : iczec. 3, 12.
saving that where Christ is said to be taken up by the divell, Ezechiell '"'"'^ '"*"
is taken up, and lifted up, and carried by the spirit of God, and yet
in a vision. But they have lesse reason that build upon this sandie
rocke, the supernaturall frame of transubstantiation ; as almost all our
witching writers doo. For Sprenger Sc Institor saie, that the divell Mai. male.
in the likenesse of a falcon caught him up. DancEUs saith, it was in
the similitude of a man ; others saie, of an angell painted with wings ;
others, invisiblie : Ergo the divell can take (saie they) what shape he lOj.
list. But though some may cavill upon the divels transforming of
himselfe ; yet, that either divell or witch can transforme or transub-
stantiat others, there is no tittle nor colour in the scriptures to helpe
them. If there were authoritie for it, and that it were past all perad-
venture, lo, what an easie matter it is to resubstantiate an asse into a
man. For Bodm saith upon the word of Apuleius, that if the asse j. Bod. lib. d<-

HESE witchmongers, for lacke of better arguments, doo

name of a witch mentioned in the whole booke. But (I praie you)

tell the truth : mother Bungle must have been gon unto, and after
she had learned hir name, whom Job most suspected, she would
have confirmed the suspicion with artificiall accusations : in the
end, some woman or other must have beene hanged for it. But as
Jo!) said ; Domitius dedit : so said he not ; Diabolus vel Lamia scd
Dominus abstidit. Which agreeth with the tenor of the text, where
it is written, that the divell at everie oi Jobs afflictions desired God
to laie his hand upon him. Insomuch sls Job imputed no part of his
calamitie unto divels, witches, nor yet unto conjurors, or their
inchantments ; as we have learned now to doo. Neither sinned he,
or did God any wrong, when he laid it to his charge : but we dis-
honour God greatlie, when we attribute either the power or proprietie
of God the creator unto a creature.

^Calvine saith ; We derogate much from Gods glorie and omnipo-
tencie, when we saie he dooth but give sathan leave to doo it : which
is (saith he) to m.ocke Gods justice ; and so fond an assertion, that if
asses could speake, they would speake more wiselie than so. For a
temporall judge saith not to the hangman ; I give thee leave to hang 81.
this oiTender, but commandeth him to doo it. But the mainteiners of
witches omnipotencie, saie ; Doo you not see how reallie and pal-
pablie the divell tempted and plagued Job ? I answer first, that there
is no corporall or visible divell named nor seene in any part of that
circumstance ; secondlie, that it was the hand of God that did it ;
thirdlie, that as there is no communitie betweene the person of a
witch, and the person of a divell, so was there not any conference or
practise betwixt them in this case.

And as touching the communication betwixt God and the divell, j.Calvincin
behold what Calvine saith, writing or rather preaching of purpose ''"^^^'"'^
upon that place, wherupon they thinke they have so great advantage;
When sathan is said to appeere before God, it is not doone in some
place certeine, but the scripture speaketh so to applie it selfe to our
rudenes. Certeinlie the divell in this and such like cases is an in-
strument to worke Gods will, and not his owne : and therefore it is
an ignorant and an ungodlie saieng (as Calvifie judgeth it) to affirme,
that God dooth but permit and suffer the divell. For if sathan were
so at his owne libertie (saith he) we should be overwhelmed at a
sudden. And doubtlesse, if he had power to hurt the bodie, there
were no waie to resist : for he would come invisiblie upon us, and
knocke us on the heads ; yea hee would watch the best and dispatch
them, whilest they were about some wicked act. If they saie ; God
commandeth him, no bodie impugneth them : but that God should
give him leave, I saie with Calviiw, that the divell is not in such
favour with God, as to obteine any such request at his hands.

And wheras by our witchmongers opinions and arguments, the
witch procureth the divell, and the divell asketh leave of God to
plague whom the witch is disposed : there is not (as I have said) any
such corporall communication betweene the divell and a witch, as
witchmongers imagine. Neither is God mooved at all at sathans sute,
who hath no such favour or grace with him, as to obteine any thing
at his hands.

But M. Mai. and his friends denie, that there were any witches in
Jobs time : yea the witchmongers are content to saie, that there were
none found to exercise this art in Christs time, from his birth to his
death, even by the space of thirtie three yeares. If there had beene
anie (saie they) they should have beene there spoken of. As touching
the authoritie of the booke of Job, there is no question but that it is
verie canonicall and authentike. Howbeit, manie writers, both of the
Jewes and others, are of opinion, that Moses was the author of this
booke ; and that he did set it as a looking glasse before the people :
to the intent the children of Abraham (of whose race he himselfe
came) might knowe, that God shewed favour to others that were not
of the same line, and be ashamed of their vvickednesse : seeing an
uncircumcised Painime had so well demeaned himselfe. Upon which
argument Calvine (though he had written upon the same) saith, that
Forsomuch as it is uncerteine, whether it were Res gesta or Exempli
gratia., we must leave it in suspense. Nevertheles (saith he) let us
take that which is out of all doubt ; namelie, that the Holy-ghost
hath indited the booke, to the end that the Jewes should knowe that
God hath had a people alwaies to serve him throughout the world,
even of such as were no Jewes, nor segregated from other nations.

Howbeit, I for my part denie not the veritie of the storie ; though
indeed I must confesse, that I thinke there was no such corporall
enterlude betweene God, the divell, and Job, as they imagine : neither
anie such reall presence and communication as the witchmongers
conceive and mainteine ; who are so grosse herein, that they doo not
onlie beleeve, but publish so palpable absurdities concerning such
reall actions betwixt the divell and man, as a wise man would be
ashamed to read, but much more to credit : as that S. Dunstan lead
the divell about the house by the nose with a paire of pinsors or tongs,
and made him rore so lowd, as the place roong thereof, &c : with a
thousand the like fables, without which neither the art of poperie
nor of witchcraft could stand. But you may see more of this matter
else-where, where in few words (which I thought good here to omit,
least I should seeme to use too manie repetitions) I answer effectuallie
to their cavils about this place.

Chap. 9.

The ninth Chapter.

What several I sorts of witches are mentio7ied in the scriptures, and
how the word witch is there applied.

UT what sorts of witches so ever M. Mai. or Bodin saie
there are ; Moses spake onlie of foure kinds of impious
couseners or witches (whereof our witchmongers old
I women which danse with the fairies, &c ; are none.) The
first were Prcestii^iatores Pharaotiis, which (as all divines, both
Hebrues and others conclude) were but couseners and jugglers,
deceiving the kings eies with illusions and sleights ; and making false
things to appeare as true : which nevertheles our witches cannot
doo. The seconu is Mecasapha, which is she that destroieth with
poison. The third are such as use sundrie kinds of divinations, and
hereunto perteine these words, Kasam, Onen, Ob, Idoni. The fourth
is Habar, to wit : when magicians, or rather such, as would be re-
puted cunning therein, mumble certeine secret words, wherin is
thought to be great efficacie.

These are all couseners and abusers of the people in their severall
kinds. But bicause they are all termed of our translators by the
name of witches in the Bible : therefore the lies of M. Mai. and
Bodin, and all our old wives tales are applied unto these names, and
easilie beleeved of the common people, who have never hitherto beene
instructed in the understanding of these words. In which respect, I
will (by Gods grace) shew you (concerning the signification of them)
the opinion of the most learned in our age ; speciallie of Johannes
IVierus ; who though hee himselfe were singularlie learned in the
toongs, yet for his satisfaction and full resolution in the same, he sent
for the judgement of Andrccas Massitis, the most famous Hebrician in
the world, and had it in such sense and order, as I meane to set
downe unto you. And yet I give you this note by the waie, that
witchcraft or inchantment is diverslie taken in the scriptures ; som-
times nothing tending to such end as it is commonlie thought to doo.
For in i Sajmuell, 15, 23. it is all one with rebellion. Jesabell iorhxr
idolatrous life  is called a witch. Also in the new testament, even S.
Paule saith the Galathians are bewitched, bicause they were seduced
and lead from the true understanding of the scriptures.

Item sometimes it is taken in good part ; as the magicians that came
to worship and offer to Christ: and also where Daniellxs said to be
an inchanter, yea a principall inchanter : which title being given him
in divers places of that storie, he never seemeth to refuse or dislike ;

towards other inchanters, which were meere couseners indeed : as

Sometimes such are called conjurors, as being but roges, and lewd
people, would use the name of Jesus to worke miracles, whereby,
though they being faithlesse could worke nothing ; yet is their practise
condemned by the name of conjuration. Sometimes jugglers are
called witches. Sometimes also they are called sorcerers, that
impugne the gospell of Christ, and seduce others with violent per-
suasions. Sometimes a murtherer with poison is called a witch.
Sometimes they are so termed by the verie signification of their
names ; as Ezaias, which signifieth a sorcerer. Sometimes bicause
they studie curious and vaine arts. Sometimes it is taken for woond-
ing or greeving of the hart. Yea the verie word Magus, which is
Latine for a magician, is translated a witch ; and yet it was hertofore
alwaies taken in the good part. And at this dale it is indifferent to
saie in the English toong ; She is a witch ; or, She is a wise woman.

Sometimes observers of dreames, sometimes soothsaiers, sometimes
the observers of the flieng of foules, of the meeting of todes, the fall-
ing of salt, &c : are called witches. Sometimes he or she is called a
witch, that take upon them either for gaine or glorie, to doo miracles ;
and yet can doo nothing. Sometimes they are called witches in
common speech, that are old, lame, curst, or melancholike, as a nick-
name. But as for our old women, that are said to hurt children with
their eies, or lambs with their lookes, or that pull downe
the moone out of heaven, or make so foolish a bargaine,
or doo such homage to the divell ; you shall
not read in the bible of any such
witches, or of any such actions
imputed to them.

the objectio7t conteined in Exodus 22. to wit : Thou shalt not
stiffer a witch to live, and of Simon Magus. Acts. 8.

HASAPH, being an Hebrue word, is Latined Veneficiuni,
and is in English, poisoning, or witchcraft ; if you will
so have it. The Hebrue sentence written in Exodus., 22.
is by the 70. interpretors translated thus into Greeke,




^apixuKovi ovK eTTi^eivaeTe, which in Latine is, Veneficos {sive) ve7ieficas

non retifiebitis in vita, in English, You shall not suffer anie poisoners,

or (as it is translated) witches to live. The which sentence fosephies Joseph, in

an Hebrue borne, and a man of great estimation, learning and fame, Jntiquitat.

interpreteth in this wise ; Let none of the children of Israel have any

poison that is deadlie, or prepared to anie hurtful! use. If anie be

apprehended with such stuffe, let him be put to death, and suffer that

which he ment to doo to them, for whom he prepared it. The Rabbins

exposition agree heerewithall. Lex Cornelia differeth not from this

sense, to wit, that he must suffer death, which either maketh, selleth,

or hath anie poison, to the intent to kill anie man. This word is found

in these places following : Exodus. 22, 18. Deut. 18, 10. 2. Sam.

lations, Chasaph is translated, witchcraft.

And bicause I will avoid prolixitie and contention both at once, I
will admit that Vencficce were such witches, as with their poisons did
much hurt among the children of Israeli ; and I will not denie that
there remaine such untill this daie, bewitching men, and making
them beleeve, that by vertue of words, and certeine ceremonies, they
bring to passe such mischeefes, and intoxications, as they indeed
accomplish by poisons. And this abuse in cousenage of people,
together with the taking of Gods name in vaine, in manie places of
the scripture is reprooved, especiallie by the name of witchcraft, even
where no poisons are. According to the sense which S. Paule useth
to the Galathians in these words, where he sheweth plainelie, that
the true signification of witchcraft is cousenage ; O ye foolish Gala- Gal. ?, i.

tJnatis (saith he) who hath bewitched you ? to wit, cousened or abused
you, making you beleeve a thing which is neither so nor so. Whereby
he meaneth not to aske of them, who have with charmes, &c : or with
poisons deprived them of their health, Hfe, cattail, or children, Sic:
but who hath abused or cousened them, to make them beleeve lies.
This phrase is also used hy Job. 15. But that we may be throughlie
resolved of the true meaning of this phrase used by Paiile, Gal. 3.
let us examine the description of a notable witch called Simon
Magus, made by S. Luke ; There was (saith he) in the citie of
Samaria, a certeine man called Simon,  which used witchcraft, and
bewitched the people of Smnaria, saieng that he himself was some
great man. I demand, in what other thing here do we see anie
witchcraft, than that he abused the people, making them beleeve he
could worke miracles, whereas in truth he could doo no such thing ;
as manifestlie may appeare in the 13. and 19. verses of the same
chapter : where he wondered at the miracles wrought by the apostles,
and would have purchased with monie the power of the Holy-ghost
to worke wonders.

It will be said, the people had reason to beleeve him, bicause it is
written, that he of long time had bewitched them with sorceries.
But let the bewitched Galathians be a warning both to the bewitched
Samaritans, and to all other that are cousened or bewitched through
false doctrine, or legierdemaine ; least while they attend to such
fables and lies, they be brought into ignorance, and so in time be led
with them awaie from God. And finallie, let us all abandon such
witches and couseners, as with Simon Magus set themselves in the
place of God, boasting that they can doo miracles, expound dreames,
foretell things to come, raise the dead, &c : which are the workes of
the Holy-ghost, who onlie searcheth the heart and reines, and onelie
worketh great wonders, which are now staied and accomplished in
Christ, in whome who so stedfastlie beleeveth shall not need to be
by such meanes resolved or confirmed in his doctrine and gospell.
And as for the unfaithful!, they shall have none other miracle shewed
unto them, but the signe of Jonas the prophet.

And therefore I saie, whatsoever they be that with Simon Magus
take upon them to worke such wonders, by sooth saieng, sorcerie, or
witchcraft, are but Hers, deceivers, and couseners, according to Syrachs
saieng ; Sorcerie, witchcraft, soothsaieng, and dreames, are but
vanitie, and the lawe shalbe fulfilled without such lies. God com-
manded the people, that they should not regard them that wrought
with spirits, nor soothsaiers : for the estimation that was attributed
unto them, offended God.




of Witchcraft. chap. :. 91



The second Chapter,

The place of Detiteronoinie expounded, ivherin are recited all kind
of witches J also their opinions confuted, whicJi hold that they can
worke such miracles as are imputed unto them.

[he greatest and most common objection is, that if there
were not some, which could worke such miraculous or
supernaturall feats, by themselves, or by their divels, it Deut. i8. i
should not have beene said ; Let none be found among
you, that maketh his sonne or his daughter to go through the fier, or
that useth witchcraft, or is a regarder of times, or a marker of the
flieng of fowles, or a sorcerer, or a charmer, or that counselleth with
spirits, or a soothsaier, or that asketh counsell of the dead, or (as
some translate it)  that raiseth the dead. But as there is no one place 114.
in the scripture that saith they can worke miracles, so it shalbe easie
to proove, that these were all couseners, everie one abusing the people
in hisseverall kind ; and are accurssed of God. Not that they can 86.
doo all such things indeed, as there is expressed ; but for that they
take upon them to be the mightie power of God, and to doo that
which is the onelie worke of him, seducing the people, and blas-
pheming the name of God, who will not give his glorie to anie Esay. 43, i
creature, being himselfe the king of glorie and omnipotencie. ^^- ^'^' ^■

First I aske, what miracle was wrought by their passing through
the fier .? Trulie it cannot be prooved that anie effect followed ; but
that the people were bewitched, to suppose their sinnes to be purged
thereby -, as the Spaniards thinke of scourging and whipping them-
selves. So as Gods power was imputed to that action, and so for-
bidden as an idolatrous sorcerie. What woonders worketh the
regarder of times ? What other divell dealeth he withall, than with
the spirit of superstition ? Doth he not deceive himselfe and others,
and therefore is worthilie condemned for a witch .'' What spirit useth
he, which marketh the flieng of fowles .'' Nevertheles, he is here con-
demned as a practiser of witchcraft ; bicause he couseneth the people,
and taketh upon him to be a prophet ; impiouslie referring Gods
certeine ordinances to the flittering fethers and uncerteine waies of a
bird. The like effects produceth sorcerie, charming, consultation with
spirits, soothsaieng, and consulting with the dead : in everie of the
which Gods power is obscured, his glorie defaced, and his commande-
ment infringed.

And to proove that these soothsaiers and witches are but lieng
mates and couseners ; note these words pronounced by God himselfe,



92 6. Bookc. The discoverie

Deut. i8, 14 even in the selfe same place to the children of Israeli : Although the

Gentiles suftered themselves to be abused, so as they gave eare to
these sorcerers, &c : he would not suffer them so, but would raise
them a prophet, who should speake the truth. As if he should saie ;
The other are but lieng and cousening mates, deceitful) and under-
mining merchants, whose abuses I will make knowne to my people.
And that everie one male be resolved herein, let the last sentence of
this precept be well weighed ; to wit, Let none be found among you,
• 115- that asketh counsell of (or raiseth the dead.)

?^P- 3^'- First you know the soules of the righteous are in the hands of God,

joh. 5, 21. resurrection and restauration of the bodie, read John. 5. and you

shall manifestlie see, that it is the onelie worke of the father, who hath

given the power therof to the sonne, and to none other, &c. Domimis

vanities, say, that one Parnphiins was called up out of hel, who when

he cam among the people, told manie incredible tales concerning

87. infernall actions. But herein I take up the proverbe ; Amiais

Plato, amicus Socrates, sed major arnica Veritas.

So as this last precept, or last part thereof, extending to that which
neither can be done by witch nor divell, male well expound the other
parts and points therof. For it is not ment hereby, that they can
doo such things indeed ; but that they make men beleeve they doo
them, and thereby cousen the people, and take upon them the office
of God, and therewithall also blaspheme his holie name, and take it
in vaine ; as by the words of charmes and conjurations doo appeare,
which you shall see, if you looke into these words, Habar and Idoni.

In like manner I saie you may see, that by the prohibition of divi-
nations by augurie, and of soothsaiengs, &c, who are witches, and can
indeed doo nothing but lie and cousen the people, the lawe of God
condemneth them not, for that they can worke miracles, but bicause

1398. fl?.'i7. senage, &c. Concerning other points of witchcraft conteined therein,

faith and philosophie. And the reason is therewithal! expressed in
the canon, to wit ; Bicause hereby is attributed to a creature, that
which perteineth to God oneHe and alone. So as, under this one
sentence (Thou shalt not suffer a poisoner or a witch to live) is for-
bidden both murther and witchcraft ; the murther consisting in
poison ; the witchcraft in cousenage or blasphemie.

The third Chapter.

That women have used poisoning in all ages more than men, a7id of
the inconve7iience of J)oisotiing.

S women in all ages have beene counted most apt to
conceive witchcraft, and the divels special! instruments
therin, and the onelie or cheefe practisers therof : so
also it appeareth, that they have been the first inventers,
and the greatest practisers of poisoning, and more naturallie addicted
and given thereunto than men : according to the saieng of Quintilian ;
Latrocinium faciliits in viro, veneficium iti fwmina credatn. From
whom Plinie differeth nothing in opinion, when he saith, Scientiam pun. lib. 25.
fvminariem in tieneficiis pravalere. To be short, Atigustine, Livie, ^"^' ^"
Valerius, Diodortis, and manie other agree, that women were the
first inventers and practisers of the art of poisoning. As for the rest
of their cunning, in what estimation it was had, may appeare by these
verses of Horace, wherein he doth not onelie declare the vanitie of
witchcraft, but also expoundeth the other words, wherewithal! we are
now in hand.

Democritus give us the names of a great manie magical! hearbs and

Of divers poisoning practises, otherwise called venejicia, committed
in Italie, Gemta, Millen, Wiitenberge, also how they were dis-
covered and executed.

NOTHER practise, not unlike to that mentioned in the Venefica
former chapter, was doone in Cassalis at Salassia in '" ^'^''^'
Italic, Anno 1536. where 40. Venejicce or witches being of
one confederacie, renewed a plague which was then
almost ceased, besmeering with an ointment and a pouder, the posts
and doores of mens houses ; so as thereby whole families were
poisoned: and of that stuffe they had prepared above 40. crocks for
that purpose. Herewithall they conveied inheritances as it pleased
them, till at length they killed the brother and onelie sonne of one
Necus (as lightlie none died in the house but the maisters and their
children) which was much noted; and therewithall that one Andro-
giita haunted the houses, speciallie of them that died: and she being
suspected, apprehended, and examined, confessed the fact, conspiracie,
and circumstance, as hath beene shewed. The like villanie was
afterwards practised at Genua, and execution was doone upon the veneficae
offenders. At Milleti there was another like attempt that tooke none ^" Genua
effect. This art consisteth as well in poisoning of cattell as of men:
and that which is doone by poisons unto cattell, towards their destruc-
tion, is as commonlie attributed to witches charms as the other. And
I doubt not, but some that would be thought cunning in incantations,
and to doo miracles, have experience in this behalf For it is written
by divers authors, that if wolves doong be hidden in the mangers,

(through the antipathie of the nature of the woolfe and other cattell)
all the beasts that savour the same doo not onlie forbeare to eate, but
run about as though they were mad, or (as they say) bewitched.

But Wierus telleth a notable storie of a Venejiciis, or destroier of 120.
cattell, which I thought meete heere to repeat. There was (saith he) Of a but-
in the dukedome of Wittijigberge, not farre from Tubing, a butcher, veneficau''^
anno 1564. that bargained with the towne for all their hides which which [? witch.]
were of sterven cattell, called in these parts Morts. He with poison
privilie killed in great numbers, their bullocks, sheepe, swine, &c: and
by his bargaine of the hides and tallowe he grew infinitlie rich.
And at last being suspected, was examined, confessed the matter and
maner thereof, and was put to death with hot tongs, wherewith his
flesh was pulled from his bones. We for  our parts would have killed 90.
five poore women, before we would suspect one rich butcher.

The fift Chapter.

A great objeciio7i ansiuered concerning tliis kind of tuitchcraft
called Veneficiitm.

IT is objected, that if Veneficitim were comprehended
under the title of manslaughter, it had beene a vaine
repetition, and a disordered course undertaken by Moses,
to set foorth a lawe against Veneficas severallie. But it
might suffice to answer any reasonable christian, that such was the
pleasure of the Holie-ghost, to institute a particular article herof, as
of a thing more odious, wicked and dangerous, than any other kind of
murther. But he that shall read the lawe of Moses, or the testament
of Christ himselfe, shall find this kind of repetition and reiteration of
the law most common. For as it is written Exod. ii, 21. Thou shalt
not greeve nor afflict a stranger, for thou wast a stranger in the land of
Aegypt: so are the same words found repeated in Levit. 19, 33. Polling
and shaving of heads and beards is forbidden in Dent. 27. which was
before prohibited in 22. It is written in Exodus the 20. Thou shalt
not steale : and it is repeated in Leviticus 19. and in Detit. 5. Mur-
ther is generallie forbidden in Exod. 20. and likewise in 22. and
repeated in Num. 35. But the aptest example is, that magicke is
forbidden in three severall places, to wit, once in Levit. 19. and twise
in Levit. 20. For the which a man might as well cavill with the
Holie-ghost as for the other.

In what kind of cojifections that witchcraft, which is called Veni-

S touching this kind of witchcraft, the principall part
thereof consisteth in certeine confections prepared by
lewd people to procure love; which indeed are meere
poisons, bereaving some of the benefit of the braine, and
so of the sense and understanding of the mind. And from some it
taketh awaie life, & that is more common than the other. These be
called Philtra, or Pocula amatoria, or Venenosa poctda, or Hippo-
jnanes; which bad and blind physicians rather practise, than witches
or conjurers, &c. But of what value these babies are, towards the
end why they are provided, may appeere by the opinions of poets
themselves, from whence was derived the estimation of that stuffe.

 is proved by more credible writers, that love cups rather ingender
death through venojite, thatt love by art: and with what toies
they destroie cattell., and procure love.

||UT bicause there is no hold nor trust to these poets, who
saie and unsaie, dallieng with these causes; so as indeed
the wise may perceive they have them in derision : let
us see what other graver authors speake hereof. Euse-
bius CcEsariensis writeth, that the poet Lucretius was killed with one
of those lovers poisoned cups. Hieronie reporteth that one Livia
herewith killed hir husband, whome she too much hated ; and
Lucilla killed hirs, whome she too much loved. Calisthenes killed
Lucius Lucjillus the emperor with a love pot, as Plutarch and
Cornelius Nepos saie. Plinie & Josephus report, that Ccesonia killed
hir husband Caligula Amatorio poculo with a lovers cup, which was
indeed starke poison. Aristotle saith, that all which is beleeved
touching the efficacie of these matters, is lies and old wives tales. He
that will read more arguments and histories concerning these poisons,
let him looke in J. Wier De Venejiciis. 
124. The toies, which are said to procure love, and are exhibited in their
poison looving cups, are these: the haire growing in the nethermost
part of a woolves taile, a woolves yard, a little fish called Retnora, the
braine of a cat, of a newt, or of a lizzard: the bone of a greene frog, the
flesh thereof being consumed with pismers or ants; the left bone
whereof ingendereth (as they saie) love; the bone on the right side,
hate. Also it is said, that a frogs bones, the flesh being eaten
off round about with ants, whereof some will swim, and some will
sinke: those that sinke, being hanged up in a white linnen cloth,
ingender love, but if a man be touched therewith, hate is bred thereby.
Another experiment is thereof, with yoong swalowes, whereof one

till they be starved up; they that be found open mouthed, serve to
engender love; they whose mouthes are shut, serve to procure hate.
Besides these, manie other follies there be to this purpose proposed
to the simple ; as namelie, the garments of the dead, candels that
burne before a dead corps, and needels wherwith dead bodies are
sowne or sockt into their sheetes: and diverse other things, which for

referreth this word to poison. But he reigneth or rather
rideth over him, much more for speaking false Greeke ;
affirming that he calleth Veneficos ^apfiaKevav}, which is as true as
the rest of his reports and fables of witches miracles conteined in

Logicke, more than the others ill Greeke. For it is well knowne to
the learned in this toong, that the usuall and proper signification of
this word, with all his derivations and compounds doo signifie
Veneficos, Poisoners by medicine. Which when it is most usuall and
proper, why should the translators take it in a signification lesse
usuall, and nothing proper. Thus therefore he reasoneth and con-

Ergo in that place it is so to be taken, when another fitter word

with his other vaine actions. The Scptiiaginta had beene verie desti-
tute of words, if no proper word could have beene found for this
purpose. But where they have occasion to speake of witchcraft in
their translations, they use Magia7t, Maggagian, &c : and

God, to assist them in that needfull case ; and then commanded
sathan in the name of the eternall God, and of his sonne Jesus
Christ, to speake with such a voice as they might understand, and to
declare from whence he came. But he would not speake, but rored

and was so strong in the maid, that foure men could scarse hold hir

downe. And this continued by the space almost of two houres. So

sometimes we charged him earnestlie to speake ; and againe praieng

unto GOD that he would assist us, at the last he spake, but verie

strangelie ; and that was thus ; He comes, he comes : and that

oftentimes he repeated ; and He goes, he goes. And then we

95. charged him to tell us who sent him. And he said; I laie in her waie

like a log, and I made hir runne like fier, but I could not hurt hir.

And whie so, said we .'' Bicause God kept hir, said he. When

earnest thou to her, said we ? To night in her bed, said he. Then

we charged him as before, to tell what he was, and who sent him,

and what his name was. At the first he said, The divell, the divell.

Then we charged him as before. Then he rored and cried as before,

and spake terrible words ; I will kill hir, I will kill hir ; I will teare

hir in peeces, I will teare hir in peeces. We said, Thou shalt not hurt

hir. He said, I will kill you all. We said, Thou shalt hurt none of

us all. Then we charged him as before. Then he said, You will

give me no rest. Wee said. Thou shalt have none here, for thou

must have no rest within the servants of God : but tell us in the

name of God what thou art, and who sent thee. Then he said he

would teare hir in peeces. We said. Thou shalt not hurt hir. Then

128. he said againe he would kill us all. We said againe, Thou shalt hurt

none of us all, for we are the servants of God. And we charged him

as before. And he said againe, Will you give me no rest? We said,

Thou shalt have none here, neither shalt thou rest in hir, for thou

hast no right in hir, sith Jesus Christ hath redeemed hir with his

bloud, and she belongeth to him ; and therefore tell us thy name,

and who sent thee? He said his name was sathan. We said, Who

sent thee ? He said. Old Alice, old Alice. Which old Alice, said we ?

Old Alice, said he. Where dwelleth she, said we? In Westwell

him? In two bottels, said he. Where be they, said we? In the

backside of hir house, said he. In what place, said we ? Under the

said we? In the ground, said he. Then we asked him, what she did

give him. He said, hir will, hir will. What did shee bid thee doo,

said we? He said, Kill hir maid. Wherefore did she bid thee kill

hir, said we ? Bicause she did not love hir, said he. We said ; How

long is it ago, since she sent thee to hir ? More than a yeare, said he.

Ager of Dig, was a Gentleman of xl. pounds land by the yeare, a

languished long before he died. Whom else hast thou killed for hir,
said we ? Woltois wife said he. Where did she dwell ? In West-
well said he. What else hast thou doone for hir said we ? What
she would have me, said he. What is that said we ? To fetch
hir meat, drinke, and corne, said he. Where hadst thou it, said
we ? In everie house, said he. Name the houses, said we ?
At Pet mans, at Farmes, at Milieus, at Fullers, and in everie house.
After this we commanded sathan in the name of Jesus Christ to
depart from hir, and never to trouble hir anie more, nor anie man
else. Then he said he would go, he would go : but he went not.
Then we commanded him as before with some more words. Then
he said, I go, I go; and so he departed. Then said the maid, He is
gone, Lord have mercie upon me, for he would have killed me. And
then we kneeled downe and gave God thanks with the maiden;
praieng that God would keepe hir from sathans power, and assist hir
with his grace. And noting this in a peece of paper, we departed.

spake, was in his owne name. Subscribed thus :

How the lewd practise of the Pythonist of Westwell came to light,
and by whome she 2uas examined ; and that all hir diabolicall
speach was but ventriloquie and plaiiie coiisenage, which is
prooved by hir owne confession.

T is written, that in the latter dales there shalbe shewed
strange Illusions, &c: in so much as (if it were possible)
the verie elect shalbe deceived: howbeit, S. Paule saith,
they shalbe lieng and false woonders. Neverthelesse,
this sentence, and such like, have beene often laid in my dish, and are
urged by diverse writers, to approve the miraculous working of witches,
whereof I will treat more largehe in another place. Howbeit, by the
waie I must confesse, that I take that sentence to be spoken of Anti-
christ, to wit: the pope, who miraculouslie, contrarie to nature,
philosophie, and all divmitie, being of birth and calling base, in
learning grosse; in valure, beautie, or activitie most commonlie a verie
lubber, hath placed himselfe in the most loftie and delicate seate,
putting almost all christian princes heads, not onelie under his girdle,
but under his foote, &:c.

Surelie, the tragedie of this Pythonist is not inferior to a thousand
stories, which will hardlie be blotted out of the memorie and credit
either of the common people, or else of the learned. How hardlie
will this storie suffer discredit, having testimonie of such authoritie t
How could mother Alice escape condemnation and hanging, being
arreigned upon this evidence ; when a poore woman hath beene cast
away, upon a cousening oracle, or rather a false lie, devised by Feats
the juggler, through the malicious instigation of some of hir adver-
saries .''

But how cunninglie soever this last cited certificat be penned, or
what shew soever it carrieth of truth and plaine dealing, there maybe
found conteined therein matter enough to detect the cousening
knaverie therof. And yet diverse have been deepelie deceived there-



of Wit die raft. chap. 2. 105

with, and canhardlie be removed from the credit thereof, and without iji.
great disdaine cannot endure to heare the reproofe thereof. And
know you this by the waie, that heretofore Robin goodfellow, and
Hob gobblin were as terrible, and also as credible to the people, as
hags and witches be now: and in time to come, a witch will be as
much derided and contemned, and as plainlie perceived, as the
illusion and knaverie of Robin goodfellow. And in truth, they that
mainteine walking spirits, with their transformation, &c: have no
reason to denie Robin goodfellow, upon whom there hath gone as
manie and as credible tales, as upon witches ; saving that it hath not
pleased the translators of the Bible, to call spirits by the name of
Robin goodfellow, as they have termed divinors, soothsaiers, poi-
soners, and couseners by the name of witches.

But to make short worke with the confutation of this bastardlie
queanes enterprise, & cousenage ; you shall understand, that upon
the brute of hir divinitie and miraculous transes, she was convented
before M. Thomas Wotton of Bocton JMalherbe, a man of great
worship and wisedome, and for deciding and ordering of matters in
this commonwealth, of rare and singular dexteritie ; through whose
discreet handling of the matter, with the assistance & aid of M.
Georj^e Darrell esquire, being also a right good and discreet Justice of The Pvtho-
the same limit, the fraud was found, the coosenage confessed, and she weiVcou-'^^'
received condigne punishment. Neither was hir confession woone, T"'^'^ '°'^

extremitie of tortures, nor yet by guile or flatterie, nor by presump-

illusion was manifestlie disclosed: not so (I say) as  witches are 98.
commonlie convinced and condemned ; to wit, through malicious
accusations, by ghesses, presumptions, and extorted confessions,
contrarie to sense and possibilitie, and for such actions as they can
shew no triall nor example before the wise, either by direct or indirect
meanes; but after due triall she shewed hir feats, illusions, and
transes, with the residue of all hir miraculous works, in the pre-
sence of divers gentlemen and gentlewomen of great worship
and credit, at Bocton Alalherbe, in the house of the
aforesaid M. Wotton. Now compare this

you shall see that both the

Bodins stuffe concerning the Pyihonist of Endor, with a true
storie of a counterfeit Dutchman.

PON the like tales dooth Bodin build his doctrine, calling
them Atheists that will not beleeve him, adding to this
kind of witchcraft, the miraculous works of diverse
maidens, that would spue pins, clowts, &c: as one Agnes
Brigs, and Rachell Finder of London did, till the miracles were
detected, and they set to open penance. Others he citeth of that
sort, the which were bound by divels with garters, or some such like
stuffe to posts, &c: with knots that could not be undone, which is an
Aegyptians juggling or cousening feat. And of such foolish lies
joined with bawdie tales, his whole booke consisteth: wherein I
warrant you there are no fewer than twoo hundreth fables, and as
manie impossibilities. And as these two wenches, with the maiden
of Westwell, were detected of cousenage; so Hkewise a Dutchman at
Maidstone long after he had accomplished such knaveries, to the
astonishment of a great number of good men, was revealed to be a
cousening knave; although his miracles were imprinted and published
at London: anno 1572. with this title before the booke, as foUoweth.

wards brought him into suspicion, he should have gone awaie unsus-

are so reverenced, as they which suspect them, are rather called to

Howbeit, the godlie and learned fathers (as it appeereth) have
alwaies had a speciall care and respect, that they attributed not unto
God such divelish devises; but referred them to him, who indeed is
the inventer and author thereof, though not the personall executioner,
in maner and forme as they supposed : so as the matter of faith was
not thereby by them impeached. But who can assure himselfe not to
John. 20, 9. be deceived in matters concerning spirits, when the apostles them-

selves were so far from knowing them, as even after the resurrection
of Christ, having heard him preach and expound the scriptures, all
his life time, they shewed themselves not onelie ignorant therein, but
also to have misconceived thereof? Did not the apostle Tlionias
thinke that Christ himselfe had beene a spirit; until Christ told him
plainelie, that a spirit was no such creature, as had flesh and bones,
the vvhicii (he said) Tlioinas xm^\ see to be in him .'' And for the
further certifieng and satisfieng of his mind, he commended unto him
his hands to be scene, and his sides to be felt. Thomas, if the
answer be true that some make hereunto, to wit : that spirits take
^35- formes and  shapes of bodies at their pleasure, might have answered
Christ, and remaining unsatisfied might have said ; Oh sir, what do
you tell me that spirits have no flesh and bones ? Why they can
take shapes and formes, and so perchance have you doone. Which
argument all the witchmongers in the world shall never be able to
answere.

Some of them that mainteine the creation, the transformation, the
transportation, and transubstantiation of witches, object that spirits are
not palpable, though visible, and answer the place by me before cited:
so as the feeling and not the seeing should satisfie Thomas. But
he that shall well weigh the text and the circumstances thereof, shall
perceive, that the fault of Thomas his incredulitie was secondlie
bewraied, and condemned, in that he would not trust his owne eies,
nor the view taken by his fellow apostles, who might have beene thought
too credulous in this case, if spirits could take shapes at their pleasure.

John. 20, jg. Jesus saith to him; Bicause thou hast scene (and not, bicause thou

hast felt) thou beleevest. Item he saith; Blessed are they that
beleeve and see not (and not, they that beleeve and feele not.)
Whereby he noteth that our corporall eies may discerne betwixt a
spirit and a naturall bodie; reprooving him, bicause he so much
relied upon his externall senses, in cases where faith should have
prevailed; & here, in a matter of faith revealed in the word, would
not credit the miracle which was exhibited unto him in most naturall
and sensible sort.

producing examples thereof, to wit: Spectrton Germanicum seu

Why Apollo was called Pytho ivhereof those witches were called
Pythonists : Gregorie his letter to the divell.

|UT to returne to our oracle of Apollo at Dclphos, who
was called Pytho, for that Apollo slue a serpent so called,
whereof the Pythonists take their name : I praie you con-
sider well of this tale, which I will trulie rehearse out of
the ecclesiasticall historic, written by Eusebius^ wherein you shall see
the absurditie of the opinion, the cousenage of these oraclers, and the
deceived mind or vaine opinion of so great a doctor bewraied and
deciphered altogither as followeth.

Gregorie Neoccesariensis in his jornie and waie to passe over the
Alpes, came to the temple of Apollo : where Apollos priest living
richlie upon the revenues and benefit proceeding from that idoU, did
give great intertainement unto Gregorie, and made him good cheare.
But after Gregorie was gone, Apollo waxed dumbe, so as the priests
gaines decaied: for the idoll growing into contempt, the pilgrimage
ceased. The spirit taking compassion upon the priests case, and upon
his greefe of mind in this behalfe, appeared unto him, and told him
flatlie, that his late ghest Gregorie was the cause of all his miserie.
For (saith the divell) he hath banished me, so that I cannot returne
without a speciall licence or pasport from him. It was no need to
bid the priest make hast, for immediatlie he tooke post horsses, and
galloped after Gregorie, till at length he overtooke him, and then
expostulated with him for this discourtesie profered in recompense of
his good cheare; and said, that if he would not be so good unto him,
as to write his letter to the divell in his belialfe, he should be utterlie

Gregorie his letter to the divell, who wrote unto him in maner and
forme following, word for word : Permitto tibi redire in locum ttntm,
&^ af^ere qiicE co7istievisti \ which is in English; I am content thou
returne into thy place, and doo as thou wast woont. Immediatlie
upon the receipt of this letter, the idoll spake as before. And here
is to be noted, that as well in this, as in the execution of all their
other oracles and cousenages, the answers were never given Ex tem-
pore, or in that daie wherein the question was demanded, because
forsooth they expected a vision (as they said) to be given the night
following, whereby the cousenage might the more easilie be wrought.

Apollo, who was called Pytho, coj>ipared to the Rood of grace :
Gregories letter to the divell confuted.

HAT need manie words to confute this fable? For if
Gregorie had beene an honest man, he would never have
willinglie permitted, that the people should have beene
further cousened with such a lieng spirit: or if he had
beene halfe so holie as Eusebitis maketh him, he would not have con-
sented or yeelded to so lewd a request of the priest, nor have written
such an impious letter, no not though good might have come thereof.
And therefore as well by the impossibilitie and follie conteined therein,
as of the impietie (whereof I dare excuse Gregorie) you male perceive it
to be a lie. Me thinks they which still mainteine that the divell made
answer in the idoll oi Apollo, &c; maie have sufficient persuasion to
revoke their erronious opinions: in that it appeareth in record, that
such men as were skilfull in augurie, did take upon them to give
oracles at Delphos, in the place of Apollo : of which number Tisanius
the Sonne of ^;zz^r;«j was one. But vaine is the answer of idols.
Our Rood of grace, with the helpe of little S. Rtiniball, was not
inferior to the idoll of Apollo : for these could  not onlie worke
externall miracles, but manifest the internall thoughts of the hart, I
beleeve with more livelie shew, both of humanitieand also of divinitie,
than the other. As if you read M. Lamberts booke of the peram-
bulation oi Kent, it shall partlie appeare. But if you talke with them
that have beene beholders thereof, you will be satisfied herein. And
yet in the blind time of poperie, no man might (under paine of
damnation) nor without danger of death, suspect the fraud. Naie,
what papists will yet confesse they were idols, though the wiers that
made their eies gogle, the pins that fastened them to the postes to

The seventh Chapter.

How diverse great clarkes ajid good authors have beene abused in
this matter of spirits through false reports, and by meanes of
their credulitie have published lies, which are confuted by Aris-
totle and the scriptures.

write that in times past beasts spake, and that images
could have spoken and wept, and did let fall drops of

doone by procuration of spirits. But I rather thinke with Aristotle,
that it was brought to passe Hominum fir= sacerdotum deceptionibus,
to wit: by the cousening art of craftie knaves and priests. And there-
fore let us follow Esaies advise, who saith; When they shall saie unto Esai. 8, 19.
you, Enquire of them that have a spirit of divination, and at the sooth-
saiers, which whisper and mumble in your eares to deceive you, &c:
enquire at your owne God, &c. And so let us doo. And here you
see they are such as runne into corners, and cousen the people with

of our vertuous predecessors, and repeating the examples of diverse
excellent men- namelie of Samuel: even as the text it selfe urgeth
the matter, according to the deceived mind and imagination of Saule,
and his servants. And therefore in truth, Sirach spake there accord-
ing to the opinion oi Saule., which so supposed, otherwise it is neither
heresie nor treason to saie he was deceived.

He that weigheth well that place, and looketh into it advisedlie,
shall see that Sainifel was not raised from the dead; but that it was an
illusion or cousenage practised by the witch. For the soules of the
righteous are in the hands of God: according to that which Chrysos-
tonie saith; Soules are in a certeine place expecting judgement, and
cannot remove from thence. Neither is it Gods will, that the living
should be taught by the dead. Which things are confirmed and
approved by the example oi Lazarus and Dives : where it appeareth
according to Detit. i8. that he will not have the living taught by the
dead, but will have us sticke to his word, wherein his will and testa-
ment is declared. In deed  Lyra and Dionyshis incline greatlie to the
letter. And Lyra saith, that as when Balaam would have raised a divell,
God interposed himselfe: so did he in this case bring up Samiiell,
when the witch would have raised hir divell. Which is a probable
interpretation. But yet they dare not stand to that opinion, least they
should impeach S. Aiigustines credit, who (they confesse) remained in
judgement and opinion (without contradiction of the church)  that
Saimtell was not raised. For he saith directlie, that 6"a;«z^^ himselfe
was not called up. And indeed, if he were raised, it was either wil-
linglie, or perforce: if it were willinglie, his sinne had beene equall
with the witches.

And Peter Martyr (me thinks) saith more to the purpose, in these
words, to wit: This must have beene doone by Gods good will, or
perforce of art magicke: it could not be doone by his good will,
bicause he forbad it ; nor by art, bicause witches have no power over
the godlie. Where it is answered by some, that the commandement
was onlie to prohibit the Jewes to aske counsell of the dead, and so
no fault in Saimtell to give counsell. We may as well excuse our

neighbours wife, for consenting to our filthie desires, bicause
it is onlie written in the decalog ; Thou shalt not desire
thy neighbours wife. But indeed 6"a;;?^^? was direct-
lie forbidden to answer Saule before he died:
and therefore it was not likelie that
God would appoint him, when
he was dead, to
doo it.

The ninth Chapter.

That Samuel was 7iot raised indeed, and how Rodin and all
papists dote herein^ and that soules cannot be raised by witch-
craft.

URTHERMORE, it is not likelie that God would answer
Saule by dead Samuell, when he would not answer him
by living Samuell : and most unlikelie of all, that God
would answer him by a divell, that denied to doo it by a
prophet. That he was not brought up perforce, the whole course of
the scripture witnesseth, and prooveth ; as also our owne reason may 141.
give us to understand. For what quiet rest could the soules of the
elect enjoy or possesse in Abrahatns bosome, if they were to be
plucked from thence at a witches call and commandement ? But so
should the divell have power in heaven, where he is unworthie to
have anie place himselfe, and therefore unmeete to command others.

for the greatest matter (saith he) laid unto his charge, is the reserving

opinion with manie ridiculous fables, & with this argument, to wit :
His fault was too little to deserve damnation ; for Paule would not i. Cor. 5.
have the incestuous man punished too sore, that his soule might be j. Martyr in
saved. Justine Martyr in another place was not onlie deceived in the coiioquio
actuall raising up of Samuels soule, but affirmed that all the soules of nTjiidL^''^'
the prophets and just men are subject to the power of witches. And 105.
yet were the Heathen much more fond herein, who (as Lactantius Lact. lib. 7.
affirmeth) boasted that they could call up the soules of the dead, and '^'^^' '•''■
yet did thinke that their soules died with their bodies. Whereby is
to be seene, how alwaies the world hath beene abused in the matters
of witchcraft & conjuration. The Necromancers affirme, that the
spirit of anie man may be called up, or recalled (as they terme it)
before one yeare be past after their departure from the bodie. Which

That neither the divell nor Samtiell was raised, hit that it ivas a
nieere consenage, accordijig to the guise of our Pythonists.

JGAINE, if the divell appeared, and not Samuell : whie is
it said in Eccle. that he slept ? for the divell neither
sleepeth nor dieth. But in truth we may gather, that it
was neither the divell in person, nor Samuell : but a
circumstance is here described, according to the deceived opinion and
imagination of Saule. Howbeit Atigustitie saith, that both these
sides may easilie be defended. But we shall not need to fetch an
exposition so farre off : for indeed (me thinkes) it is Longe petita ;
nor to descend so lowe as hell, to fetch up a divell to expound this
place. For it is ridiculous (as Pompanacitis saith) to leave manifest
things, and such as by naturall reason may be prooved, to seeke
unknowne things, which by no likeliehood can be conceived, nor tried
by anie rule of reason. But in so much as we have libertie by S.
Atigustines rule, in such places of scripture as seeme to conteine
either contrarietie or absurditie, to varie from the letter, and to make
a godlie construction agreeable to the word ; let us confesse that
Samuell was not raised (for that were repugnant to the word) and see
whether this illusion may not be contrived by the art and cunning of
the woman, without anie of these supernaturall devices : for I could
14J. cite a hundred papisticall and cousening practises, as difficult as this,
and as cleanlie handled. And it is to be surelie thought, if it had
beene a divell, the text would have noted it in some place of the storie:
as it dooth not. But Bodin helpeth me exceedinglie in this point,

give his power and glorie to ame creature. 1 o understand this place,
we must diligentlie examine the circumstance thereof It was well
knovvne that Saule, before he resorted to the witch, was in despaire of
the mercies and goodnes of God ; partlie for that Saniucll told him
long before, that he should be overthrowne, and David should have
his place ; and partlie bicause God before had refused to answer him,
either by Samucll when he lived, or by anie other prophet, or by
Urim or Thumim, &c. And if you desire to see this matter dis-
cussed, turne to the first oi Samteell, the 28. chapter, and conferre my
words therewith.

Saule seeing the host of the Philistines come upon him (which thing 144.
could not be unknown to all the people) fainted, bicause he sawe
their strength, and his owne weaknesse, and speciallie that he was
forsaken : so as being now straught of mind, desperate, and a verie
foole, he goeth to certeine of his servants, that sawe in what taking i. Sam. 28, 7.
he was, and asked them for a woman that had a familiar spirit, and
they told him by and by that there dwelt one at Endor. By the waie
you shall understand, that both Saule and his servants ment such a one
as could by hir spirit raise up Samuell, or any other that was dead and
buried. Wherein you see they were deceived, though it were true, that
she tooke upon hir so to doo. To what use then served hir familiar
spirit, which you conceive she had, bicause Saules servants said so .''
Surelie, as they were deceived and abused in part, so doubtlesse were
they in the rest. For to what purpose (I saie) should hir familiar serve, familiar.

if not for such intents as they reported, and she undertooke ? I thinke
you will grant that Sanies men never sawe hir familiar : for I never
heard any yet of credit saie, that he was so much in the witches favour,
as to see hir divell ; although indeed we read among the popish trum-
perie, that S. Cicilie had an angell to hir familiar, and that she could
shew him to whom she would, and that she might aske and have what
107. she or hir friend list : as appeareth in the lesson read in the popish
church on saint Cicilies dale. Well, I perceive the woman of Endors
spirit was a counterfeit, and kept belike in hir closet at Etidor, or in
the bottle, with mother Alices divell at IVestwell, and are now
bewraied and fled togither to Limbo palrjun, &^c. And though Saule
were bewitched and blinded in the matter ; yet doubtlesse a wise
man wold have perchance espied her knaverie. Me thinks Sanle

D. Burcot, was brought to this witch, much after the maner that doctor Bnrcot

was brought to Feats, who sold maister Doctor a familiar, wherby
he thought to have wrought miracles, or rather to have gained good
store of monie. This fellowe by the name oi Feats was a jugler, by
the name oi Hilles a witch or conjurer, everie waie a cousener : his
qualities and feats were to me and manie other well knowne
and detected. And yet the opinion conceived of him was most
strange and woonderfull ; even with such and in such cases, as it
greeveth me to thinke of; speciallie bicause his knaverie and
^45- cousenage reached to the shedding of innocent bloud. But now

I. Sam. 28, 8 forsooth Satile covereth himselfe with a net ; and bicause he would
not be knowne, he put on other garments. But to bring that matter

I. Sa 10, 23. to passe, he must have beene cut shorter by the head and shoulders,

for by so much he was higher than any of the people. And therfore
whatsoever face the craftie quene did set upon it, she knew him well
enough. And for further proofe thereof, you may understand, that
the princes of the Jewes were much conversant with the people. And

Ibiriem. it appccrcth manifestlie, that Saule dwelt verie neere to Endor, so as

she should the rather knowe him ; for in the evening he went from
his lodging unto hir house : neither should it seeme that she was
gone to bed when he came. But bicause that may be uncerteine, you
may see in the processe of the text, that in a peece of the night he
went from his house to hirs, and with much adoo intreated her to
consent to his request. She finished hir conjuration, so as both
Saules part, the witches part, and also Samuels part was plaied : and
after the solemnization therof, a calfe was killed, a batch of bread
baked, and a supper made readie and eaten up ; and after all this, he
went home the same night : and had need so to doo, for he had some
businesse the next daie. By these and manie other circumstances it
may bee gathered, that she dissembled, in saieng she knew him not,

and consequentlie counterfaited, and made a foole of him in all the
rest.

It appeereth there, that he, with a couple of his men, went to liir ibidem,
by night, and said ; Conjecture unto me by thy familiar spirit, and
bring me up whom I shall name unto thee. The godlie learned
knowe that this was not in the power of the witch of Endor, but in the
God of heaven onelie to accomplish. Howbeit, Saicle was bewitched
so to suppose : and yet is he more simple that will be overtaken with
the devises of our old witches, which are produced to resemble hir.
And why should we thinke, that GOD would rather permit the witch to
raise Saintiel, than that Dives could obteine Lazarus to come out of
Ab7'ahanis bosome, upon more likelie and more reasonable condi-
tions.-' Well now dooth this strumpet (according to the guise of our
cousening witches and conjurers) make the matter strange unto
Smih\ saieng that he came to take hir in a snare, &c. But witches i- Sam. 28,9. 108.
seldome make this objection, saving when they mistrust that he which 14^-
commeth to them will espie their jugling : for otherwise, where the
witchmonger is simple and easie to be abused, the witch will be as
easie to be intreated, and nothing dangerous of hir cunning ; as you
see this witch was soone persuaded (notwithstanding that objection)
bicause she perceived and sawe that Saule was afifraid and out of his
wits. And therfore she said unto him; Whom shall I raise up? i. Sa. 28. 12.

The 12. 13. (Sr» 14. verses of i. Samuel 28. expounded : ivherin is
shewed that Saule was cousened and abused by the witch, and
that Samuel was not raised, is prooved by the witches owne talke.

IjHE manner and circumstance of their communication, or
of hir conjuration, is not verbatim set downe and ex-
pressed in the text ; but the effect thereof breeflie
touched : yet will I shew you the common order of their
conjuration, and speciallie of hirs at this time used. When Saule The maner
had told hir, that he would have Samuel brought up to him, she of Endors
departed from his presence into hir closet, where doubtles she had '^^ g^'^^j'"^
hir familiar ; to wit, some lewd craftie preest, and made Saule stand
at the doore like a foole (as it were with his finger in a hole) to heare
the cousening answers, but not to see the cousening handling thereof,

and the couterfetting of the matter. And so goeth she to worke, using
ordinarie words of conjuration, of which there are sundrie varieties
and formes (whereof I shall have occasion to repeat some in another
place) as you see the juglers (which be inferior conjurors) speake
147- certeine strange words of course to lead awaie the eie from espieng
the maner of their conveiance, whilest they may induce the mind to
conceive and suppose that he dealeth with spirits ; saieng, Hay,
fortH7te furie^ nunqj credo, passe, passe, when come you sirra. So
belike after many such words spoken, she saith to hir selfe ; Lo now
the matter is brought to passe, for I see woonderfull things. So as

I. Sa. 28, 13. Saule hearing these words, longed to knowe all, and asked hir what
she sawe, Whereby you may know that Sajile sawe nothing, but
stood without like a mome, whilest she plaied hir part in hir closet :

1. Sa. :8, 21. as may most evidentlie appeere by the 21. verse of this chapter where
it is said ; Then the woman came out unto Saule. Howbeit, a little
before she cunninglie counterfaited that she sawe Samuel, and thereby
knewe it was Saule that was come unto hir. Whereby all the world
may perceive the cousening, and hir dissimulation. For by that
which hath beene before said, it must needs be that she knew him.
And (I praie you) why should she not have suspected aswell him to
be Saule before, when in expresse words he required hir to bring
unto him Samuel, as now, when Sainnel appeered unto hir .'' 

i.Sa.28, 4.109. Well, to the question before proposed by Saule, she answereth and
lieth, that she saw angels or gods ascending up out of the earth.
Then proceedeth she with her inchanting phrases and words of
course : so as thereby Satcle gathereth and supposeth that she hath
raised a man. For otherwise his question dependeth not upon any
thing before spoken. For when she hath said; I sawe angels ascend-
ing, &c : the next word he saith is ; What fashion is he of? Which
(I saie) hangeth not upon hir last expressed words. And to this
she answered not directlie, that it was Samuel ; but that it was an old
man lapped in a mantell : as though she knew not him that was the
most notorious man in Israeli, that had beene her neighbour by the
space of manie yeeres, and upon whom (while he lived) everie eie
was fixed, and whom also she knew within lesse than a quarter of an
houre before, as by whose meanes also she came acquainted with

I. Sa. 28, 12. Saule. Read the text and see.

But she describeth his personage, and the apparell which he did
usuallie weare when he lived : which if they were both buried to-
gither, were consumed and rotten, or devoured with wormes before
148. that time. Belike he had a new mantell made him in heaven : and
yet they saie Tailors are skantie there, for that their consciences are
so large here. In this countrie, men give awaie their garments when

they die : if Satmeel had so doone, hee could not have borrowed it
againe ; for of likliehood it would have beene worne out in that space,
except the donee had beene a better husband than I : for the testator
was dead (as it is supposed) two yeares before.

The xiii. Chapter,

The residue of i. SaJii. 28. expounded : ivherin is declared how
cunuinglie this witch brought Saide resolutelie to beleeve that she
raised Samuel, what words are used to colour the cousenage, and
hotv all might also be wrought by ventriloquie.

||0W commeth in Samuel to plaie his part : but I am per-
suaded it was performed in the person of the witch hir
selfe, or of hir confederate. He saith to Saule ; Why i- Sa. 28, 15.
has thou disquieted me, to bring me up ? As though
without guile or packing it had beene Samuel himselfe. Saule ibidem.
answered that he was in great distresse : for the Philistines made warre
upon him. Whereby the witch, or hir confederate priest might easilie
conjecture that his heart failed, and direct the oracle or prophesie
accordinglie : especiallie understanding by his present talke, and
also by former prophesies and dooings that were past, that God had
forsaken him, and that his people were declining from him. For
when JonatJiaii (a little before) overthrew the Philistines, being thirtie
thousand chariots and six thousand horssemen ; Saule could not
assemble above six hundred souldiers. i. Sa. 13, 15.

Then said Samuel (which some suppose was sathan, and as I
thinke was the witch, with a confederate ; for what need so farre
fetches, as to fetch a divell supernaturallie out of hell, when the
illusion may be here by natu rail meanes deciphered ? And if you 110.
note the words well, you shall perceive the phrase not to come out
of a spirituall mouth of a divell, but from a lieng corporall toong of I4g.
a cousener, that careth neither for God nor the divell, fro whence
issueth such advise and communication, as greatlie disagreeth from
sathans nature and purpose. For thus (I saie) the said Samuel
speaketh : Wherefore dooest thou aske me, seeing the Lord is gone i. Sam. 28.
from thee, and is thine enemie.-' Even the Lord hath doon unto him ' ' ''^'
as he spake by mine hand: for the Lord will rent thy kingdome out >• Sa. 15, 28.
of thine hand, and give it to thy neighbour David, bicause thou
obeiedst not the voice of the Lord, &c. This (I say) is no phrase of
a divell, but of a cousener, which knew before what Samuel had
prophesied concerning Saules destruction. For it is the divels con-
dition, to allure the people unto wickednes, and not in this sort to



1 20 7- Booke. The discoverie

admonish, vvarne, and rebuke them for evill. And the popish writers
confes, that the divell would have beene gone at the first naming of
God. If it bee said, that it was at Gods speciall commandement and
will, that Saiiniel or the divell should be raised, to propound this
admonition, to the profit of all posteritie: I answer, that then he
would rather have doone it by some of his living prophets, and that
sathan had not beene so fit an instrument for that purpose. After
this falleth the witch (I would saie Samuel) into the veine of prophe-

1. Sa 28, 17. sieng, and speaketh to Sank on this wise ; The Lord will rent thy

'^' kingdome out of thine hand, and give it to thy neighbor David,

bicause thou obeiedst not the voice of the Lord, nor executedst his
fierse wrath upon the Amalekites: therefore hath the Lord doone this

19. unto thee this daie. Moreover, the Lord will deliver thee into the

hands of the Philistmes, and to morrowe shalt thou and thy sonnes be
with me, and the Lord shall give the host of Israel into the hands of
the Philtsiines. What could Samuel have said more ?

Me thinks the divell would have used another order, encouraging
Saule rather than rebuking him for his evill. The divell is craftier
than to leave such an admonition to all posterities, as should be
prejudicial! unto his kingdome, and also be void of all impietie. But
so divine a sentence maketh much for the maintenance of the witches
credit, and to the advancement of hir gaines. Howbeit, concerning the
veritie of this prophesie, there be many disputable questions: first,
whether the battell were fought the next daie; secondlie, whether all
750. his sonnes were killed with him; item, whether they went to heaven
or hell togither, as being with Samuel, they must be in heaven, and
being with sathan, they must be in hell. But although everie part of
this prophesie were false, as that all his sonnes were not slaine {Ishbo-
sheth living and reigning in Israel two yeares after Saules death) and
that the battell was not on the morrow, and that wicked Saule, after

2. Reg. 4. that he had killed himselfe, was not with good Samuel ; yet this witch

did give a shrewd gesse to the sequele. Which whether it were true

or false, perteins not to my purpose ; and therfore I will omit it. But

as touching the opinion of them that saie it was the divell, bicause

that such things came to passe ; I would faine knowe of them where

they learne that divels foreknow things to come. If they saie he

gesseth onelie upon probabilities, the witch may also doo the like.

Canon. 2(>. But here I may not forget the decrees, which conclude, that Samtiel

'ZTmirMu}' appeered not unto Satde ; but that the historiographer set foorth

111. Saules mind and Samuels estate, and certeine things which were said

& scene, omitting whether they were true or false : and further, that

it were a great offense for a man to beleeve the bare words of the

storie. And if this exposition like you not, I can easilie frame my

and that with great probabilitie, in this sort; to wit, that this
Pythotiist being Veiitriloqiia ; that is, Speaking as it were from the
bottome of hir bellie, did cast hir selfe into a transe, and so abused
Saule, answering to Saiile in Samuels name, in hir counterfeit
hollow voice : as the wench of Westzuell spake, whose historie I have
rehearsed before at large, in pag. 127 and this is right Veniriloquic.j

The xiiii. Chapter. -O'a

Opinions of some learned men., that Samuel was indeed raised, not
by the witches art or power, but by the speciall jniracle of God,
that there are no such visions in these our dales, (&-» that our
witches cannot doo the like.

IAS and Sadaias write, that when the woman sawe the
miracle indeed, and more than she looked for, or was
woont to doo; she began to crie out, that this was a
vision indeed, and a true one, not doone by hir art, but
by the power of God. Which exposition is far more probable than
our late writers judgements hereupon, and agreeth with the exposition
of diverse good divines. Gelasius saith, it was the verie spirit of
Samiiel : and where he suffered himself to be worshipped, it was but
in civill salutation and courtesie; and that God did interpose Samuel, ^- y°,Yus*
as he did Elias to the messenger of Ochosias, when he sent to differ here-
Belzebub the god of Acharon. And here is to be noted, that the
witchmongers are set up in this point: for the papists saie, that it
cannot be a divell, bicause Jehovah is thrise or five times named in
the storie. Upon this peece of scripture arguments are daielie
devised, to proove and mainteine the miraculous actions of witch-
craft, and the raising of the dead by conjurations. And yet if it were
true, that Safnuel himselfe were raised, or the divell in his likenesse;
and that the witch of Endor by hir art and cunning did it, &c: it
maketh rather to the disproofe than to the proofe of our witches,
which can neither do that kind of miracle, or any other, in any such
place or companie, where their jugling and cousenage may be seen
and laid open. And I challenge them all (even upon the adventure A bold, dis-
of my life) to shew one peece of a miracle, such as Christ did trulie, flhWuii
or such as they suppose this witch did diabolicallie, be it not with challenge
art nor confederacie, whereby some colour thereof may be made ;
neither are there any such visions in these dales shewed.

Heretofore God did send his visible angels to men : but now we 152
heare not of such apparitions, neither are they necessarie. Indeed it

pleased God heretofore, by the hand of Moses and his prophets, and
speciallie by his sonne Christ and his apostles, to worke great
112. miracles, for the establishing of the faith: but now whatsoever is
necessarie for our salvation, is conteined in the word of God : our
faith is alredie confirmed, and our church established by miracles; so
as now to seeke for them, is a point of infidelitie. Which the papists
(if you note it) are greatlie touched withall, as in their lieng legends
appeareth. But in truth, our miracles are knaveries most commonlie,
and speciallie of priests, whereof I could cite a thousand. If you
read the storie of Bell and the dragon, you shall find a cousening
miracle of some antiquitie. If you will see newer devises, read
JVz'erus, Cardanus., Baeus, and speciallie Lavaterns* &^c. There
have beene some ^walking spirits in these parts so conjured not long
since, as afterwards they little delighted to make anie more appari-
tions.

The XV. Chapter.

Of vaine apparitions., how people have beene brought to fear e bugges,
which is part lie reformed by preaching of the go spell, the true
effect of Christes miracles.

UT certeinlie, some one knave in a white sheete hath
cousened and abused manie thousands that waie; special-
lie when Robin good-fellow kept such a coile in the
countrie. But you shall understand, that these bugs
speciallie are spied and feared of sicke folke, children, women, and
cowards, which through weaknesse of mind and bodie, are shaken
with vaine dreames and continuall feare. The Scythians, being a
stout and a warlike nation (as divers writers report) never see anie
vaine sights or spirits. It is a common saieng; A lion feareth no
bugs. But in our childhood our mothers maids have so terrified us
with an ouglie divell having homes on his head, fier in his mouth, and
1^3. a taile in his breech, eies like a bason, fanges like a dog, clawes like
a beare, a skin like a Niger, and a voice roring like a lion, whereby
we start and are afraid when we heare one crie Bough : and they have
so fraied us with bull beggers, spirits, witches, urchens, elves, hags,
fairies, satyrs, pans, faunes, sylens, kit with the cansticke, tritons,
centaurs, dwarfes, giants, imps, calcars, conjurors, nymphes, chang-

manie times is taken for our fathers soule, speciallie in a churchyard,
where a right hardie man heretofore scant durst passe by night, but
his haire would stand upright. For right grave writers report, that
spirits most often and speciallie take the shape of women appearing to
monks, &c : and of beasts, dogs, swine, horsses, gotes, cats, haires ; of
fowles, as crowes, night owles, and shreeke owles; but they delight
most in the likenes of snakes and dragons. Well, thanks be to God,
this wretched and cowardlie infidelitie, since the preaching of the
gospell, is in part forgotten : and doubtles, the rest of those illusions
will in short time (by Gods grace) be detected and vanish awaie.

Divers writers report, that in Germame, since Lnthers time, spirits
and divels have not personallie appeared, as in times past they were
woont to doo. This argument is taken in hand of the ancient fathers,
to proove the determination and ceasing of oracles. For in times
past (saith Athanasius) divels in vaine shapes did intricate men with
their illusions, hiding themselves in waters, stones, woods, &c. But
now that the word of GOD hath appeared, those sights, spirits, and
mockeries of images are ceased. Truelie, if all such oracles, as that
oi Apollo, &c (before the comming of Christ) had beene true, and
doone according to the report, which hath beene brought through
divers ages, and from farre countries unto us, without preestlie fraud
or guile, so as the spirits of prophesie, and working of miracles, had
beene inserted into an idoll, as hath beene supposed: yet we christians
may conceive, that Christs coming was not so fruteles and prejudi-
ciall in this point unto us, as to take awaie his spirit of prophesie and
divination from out of the mouth of his elect people, and good
prophets, giving no answers of anie thing to come by them, nor by
Urhn nor Thumim, as he was woont, &c. And yet to leave the divell
in the mouth of a witch, or an idoll to prophesie or worke miracles,
&c: to the hinderance of his glorious gospell, to the discountenanceof
his church, and to the furtherance of infidelitie and false religion,
whereas the working of miracles was the onelie, or at least the most
speciall meanes that mooved men to beleeve in Christ: as appeareth
in sundrie places of the gospell, and speciallie in John, where it is
written, that a great multitude followed him, bicause they sawe his
miracles which he did, &c. Naie, is it not written, that Jesus was

approoved by God among the Jewes, with miracles, wonders

and signes, &c ? And yet, if we conferre the miracles

wrought by Christ, and those that are imputed

to witches ; witches miracles shall

appeare more common, and

nothing inferior

unto his.

The xvi. Chapter.

Witches miracles compared to Christs, thai God is the creator of all
things, of Apollo, and of his names and portraiture.

]f this witch of -£"«^tf?- had performed that, which manie
conceive of the matter, it might have beene compared
with the raising up of Lazarus. I praie you, is not the
converting of water into milke, as hard a matter as the
turning of water into wine ? And yet, as you may read in the gospell,
that Christ did the one, as his first miracle; so may you read in M.
Mai. and in Boditt, that witches can easiUe doo the other : yea, and
that which is a great deale more, of water they can make butter.
But to avoid all cavils, and least there should appeare more matter in
Christs miracle, than the others, you shall find in M. Mai. that they
can change water into wine: and what is it to attribute to a creature,
the power and worke of the creator, if this be not? Christ saith.
Opera qiice ego facio 7iemo potest facere. Creation of substance was
never granted to man nor angell; E7go neither to witch nor divell :
for God is the onlie giver of life and being, and by him all things are
made, visible and invisible.

Finallie, this woman of E^tdor is in the scripture called Pythonissa:

whereby it may appeare that she was but a verie cousener. For Pytho

himselfe, whereof Pytho7iissa is derived, was a counterfet. And the

originall storie of Apollo, who was called Pytho, bicause he killed a

serpent of that name, is but a poeticall fable. For the poets saie he

was the god of musicke, physicke, poetrie, and shooting. In heaven

he is called Sol, in earth Liber pater, in hell Apollo. He florisheth

alwaies with perpetuall youth, and therefore he is painted without a

beard: his picture was kept as an oracle-giver: and the preests that

attended thereon at Delphos were couseners, and called Pytho7iists of

Pytho, as papists of Papa ; and afterwards all women that used that

trade, were named Pytho7tisscE, as was this woman oi E7idor.

But bicause it concerneth this matter, I will breefelie note

the opinions of divers learned men, and cer-

teine other proofes, which I find in the

scripture touching the ceasing of

miracles, prophesies and

oracles.

The first Chapter.

That miracles are ceased.

liLTHOUGH in times past, it pleased God, extraordina-
rilie to shew miracles amongest his people, for the
strengthening of their faith in the Messias; and againe at
his comming to confirme their faith by his wonderful!
dooings, and his speciall graces and gifts bestowed by him upon the
apostles, &c: yet we ordinarilie read in the scriptures, that it is the
Lord that worketh great wonders. Yea David saith, that among the
dead (as in this case of Samuel) God himselfe sheweth no wonders. I
find also that God will not give his glorie and power to a creature.
Nichodenms being a Pharisie could saie, that no man could do such
miracles as Christ did, except God were with him, according to the
saieng of the prophet to those gods and idols, which tooke on them
the power of God ; Doo either good or ill if you can, &c. So as the
prophet knew and taught thereby, that none but God could worke
miracles. Infinite places for this purpose might be brought out of
the scripture, which for brevitie I omit and overslip.

S. At(gt(stine, among other reasons, whereby he prooveth the
ceasing of miracles, saith; Now blind flesh dooth not open the eies
of the blind by the miracle of God, but the eies of our hart are
opened by the word of God. Now is not our dead carcase raised
any more up by miracle, but our dead bodies be still in the grave,
and our soules are raised to life by Christ. Now the eares of the
deafe are not opened by miracle, but they which had their eares shut
before, have them now opened to their salvation. The miraculous
healing of the sicke, by annointing, spoken oihy S. James, is objected
by manie, speciallie by the papists, for the maintenance of their
sacrament of extreame unction : which is apishlie and vainelie used
in the Romish church, as though that miraculous gift had continu-
ance till this daie : wherein you shall see what Calvine speaketh in
his institutions. The grace of healing (saith he) spoken of by S.
James, is vanished awaie, as also the other miracles, which the Lord
would have shewed onelie for a time, that he might make the new
preaching of the gospell mervellous for ever. Why (saith he) doo not
these (meaning miraclemongers) appoint some Siloah to swim in,

plunge themselves ? Why doo they not lie a long upon the dead,
bicause Paule raised up a dead child by that meanes ? Verelie (saith
he) James in the miracle to annoint, spake for that time, whiles the
church still enjoied such blessings of God. Item, he saith, that the
Lord is present with his in all ages ; and so often as need is, he help-
eth their sicknesses, no lesse than in old time. But he dooth not so
utter his manifest powers, nor distributeth miracles, as by the hands
of the apostles, bicause the gift was but for a time. Cah'ine even
there concludeth thus ; They saie such vertues or miracles remaine,
but experience saith naie. And see how they agree among them-
selves. Danaus saith, that neither witch nor divell can worke
miracles. Giles Alley saith directlie,  that witches worke miracles.
Calvine saith they are all ceased. All witchmongers saie they con-
tinue. But some affirme, that popish miracles are vanished and gone
awaie : howbeit witches miracles remaine in full force. So as S. Loy
is out of credit for a horsseleach, Maister T. and mother Btmgie re-
maine in estimation for prophets : naie HobgobUn and Robin good-
fellow are contemned among yoong children, and mother Alice and
mother Bungie are feared among old fooles. The estimation of these
continue, bicause the matter hath not beene called in question : the
credit of the other decaieth, bicause the matter hath beene looked
into. Whereof I saie no more, but that S. Anthonies blisse will helpe
your pig, whensoever mother Bungie dooth hurt it with hir cursse.
And therefore we are warned by the word of God, in anie wise not to
feare their cursses. But let all the witchmongers, and speciallie the
miraclemongers in the world answer me to this supposition ; Put
case that a woman of credit, or else a woman-witch should saie unto
them, that she is a true prophet of the Lord, and that he revealeth
those secret mysteries unto hir, whereby she detecteth the lewd acts
and imaginations of the wicked, and that by him she worketh
miracles, and prophesieth, &c ; I thinke they must either yeeld, or
confesse that miracles are ceased. But such things (saith Cardatie)
as seeme miraculous, are cheeflie doone by deceipt, legier-
demaine, or confederacie ; or else they male
be doone, and yet seeme unpossible,
or else things are said to be
done, and never were
nor can be
doone.

The second Chapter.

That the gift of prophesie is ceased.

|HAT witches, nor the woman of Endor, nor yet hir
famihar or divell can tell what is to come, may plainelie
appeare by the words of the prophet, who saith ; Shew isai. 41.
what things are to come, and we will saie you are gods
indeed. According to that which Salomoti saith ; Who can tell a
man what shall happen him under the sunne ? Marrie that can I i- Sam. 28.
(saith the witch oi Endor to Saule.) But I will rather beleeve Paule i.°a,'r.'i2.
and Peter, which saie, that prophesie is the gift of God, and no '• ^^^- '•
worldlie thing. Then a cousening queane, that taketh upon hir to [(^. the full stop]
doo all things, and can doo nothing but beguile men : up steppeth also
mother Bingie, and she can tell you where your horsse or your asse
is bestowed, or anie thing that you have lost is become, as Saj>mell
could ; and what you have doone in all your age past, as Christ did
to the woman of Sichar ^X facobs well ; yea and what your errand is, John. 4.
before you speake, as Elizceus did.

Peter Martyr saith, that onelie God and man knoweth the heart of i^g.
man, and therefore, that the divell must be secluded, alledging these p. Martyr.

est in eo, None knoweth the things of man, but the spirit of man
which is within him. And Salomon saith, Tu solus nosti cogitationes

with God in times past endued his people, is also ceased, and counter-
feits and couseners are come in their places, according to this saieng
of Peter ; There were false prophets among the people, even as there
shalbe false teachers among you, «&:c. And thinke not that so notable
a gift should be taken from the beloved and elect people of God, and
committed to mother Bimgie, and such like of hir profession.

The words of the prophet Zacharie are plaine, touching the ceasing
both of the good and bad prophet, to wit : I will cause the prophets
and uncleane spirits to depart out of the land, and when anie shall
yet prophesie, his parents shall saie to him ; Thou shalt not live, for
thou speakest lies in the name of the Lord : and his parents shall
thrust him through when he prophesieth, &c. No, no : the foretelling
of things to come, is the onelie worke of God, who disposeth all
things sweetlie, of whose counsell there hath never yet beene anie man.
And to know our labours, the times  and moments God hath placed in
his owne power. Also Phavorinus saith, that if these cold prophets or
oraclers tell thee prosperitie, and deceive thee, thou art made a miser
through vaine expectation : if they tell thee of adversitie, &c : and lie,
thou art made a miser through vaine feare. And therefore I saie, we
male as well looke to heare prophesies at the tabernacle, in the bush,
of the cherubin, among the clouds, from the angels, within the arke, or
out of the flame, &c: as to expect an oracle of a prophet in these dales.

But p.ut the case, that one in our common wealth should step up
and saie he were a prophet (as manie frentike persons doo) who
would beleeve him, or not thinke rather that he were a lewd person ?
See the statutes Elizah. 5. whether there be not lawes made against
them, condemning their arrogancie and cousenage : see also the
canon lawes to the same effect.

Thai Oracles are ceased.

OUCHING oracles, which for the most part were idols of
silver, gold, wood, stones, &c : within whose bodies some
saie uncleane spirites hid themselves, and gave answers :
as some others saie, that exhalations rising out of the
ground, inspire their minds, whereby their priests gave out oracles ;
so as spirits and winds rose up out of that soile, and indued those men
with the gift of prophesie of things to come, though in truth they were
all devises to cousen the people, and for the profit of preests, who
received the idols answers over night, and delivered them backe to
the idolaters the next morning : you shall understand, that although




of Witchcraft. chip. 3. 129

it had beene so as it is supposed ; yet by the reasons and proofes
before rehearsed, they should now cease : and whatsoever halh
affinitie with such miraculous actions, as witchcraft, conjuration,
&c : is knocked on the head, and nailed on the crosse with Christ,
who hath broken the power of divels, and satisfied Gods justice,
who also hath troden them under his feete, & subdued them, &c. At 161.
whose comming the prophet Zacharie saith, that the Lord will cut Zach. 13, 2.
the names of idols out of the land, and they shall be no more remem-
bered; and he will then cause the prophets and uncleane spirits to
depart out of the land. It is also written; I will cut off thine Mich. 5, 12.
inchanters out of thine hand, and thou shalt have no more soothsaiers.
And indeed the gospell of Christ hath so laid open their knaverie,
&c: that since the preaching thereof, their combes are cut, and few
that are wise regard them. And if ever these prophesies came to
take effect, it must be upon the coming of Christ, whereat you see the
divels were troubled and fainted, when they met him, saieng, or
rather exclaming upon him on this wise ; Fili Dei cur venisti nos
cruciare ante tempus ? O thou sonne of God, whie commest thou to
molest us (or confound us) before our time appointed .? Which he
indeed prevented, and now remaineth he our defender and keeper
from his clawes. So as now you see here is no roome left for such
ghests.

Howbeit, you shall heare the opinion of others, that have beene as
much deceived as your selves in this matter: and yet are driven to
confesse, that GOD hath constituted his sonne to beat downe the
power of divels, and to satisfie Gods justice, and to heale our wound
received by the fall of Adam, according to Gods promise in Genesis. Gen. 3.
3. The seed of the woman shall tread downe the serpent, or the
divell. Eusebius (in his fift booke De prcedicatione Evangelii, the Etiscb. lib. 5,
title whereof is this, that the power of divels is taken awaie by the
comming of Christ) saith; All answers made by divels, all sooth-
saiengs and divinations of men are gon and vanished awaie. Item
he citeth Porphyrie in his booke against christian religion, wherein idtm. ibid.
these words are rehearsed ; It is no mervell, though the plague be so Porphyr. in
hot in this citie: for ever since Jesus hath beene worshipped, we can ^l^^iX^^dig.
obteine nothing that good is at the hands of our gods. And of this
defection and ceasing of oracles writeth Cicero long before, and that ^'■^•f'^"""'
to have happened also before his time. Howbeit, Cluysosfome j. chrysost.
living long since Cicero, saith, that Apollo was forced to grant, that '^p^j^^'\oin 4.
so long as anie relike of a martyr was held to his nose, he could not
make anie answer or oracle. So as one may perceive, that the
heathen were wiser in this behalfe than manie christians, who in
times past were called Oppirgnatores incantamentoriint, as the English 162.

[* read £■■] |h~^^^|LUTARCH saith, that his countriman *^<7z^;'j'^i' told

which he had heard. But when they came to Palodes, and the wether
calme, Thamus looking out toward the land, cried alowd, that the
o-reat god Pan was deceased: and immediatlie there followed a
lamentable noise of a multitude of people, as it were with great
vvoonder and admiration. And bicause there were manie in the ship,
they said the fame thereof was speedilie brought to Rome, and Thamus
sent for by Tiberius the Emperour, who gave such credit thereto, that
he diligentlie inquired and asked, who that Pan was. The learned men
about him supposed, that Pan was he who was the sonne of Mercuric
and Penelope, &c. Euscbius saith, that this chanced in the time of
Tiberius the Emperor, when Christ expelled all divels, &c.

Paulus Marsus, in his notes upon Ovids Fasti,?,?a\h, that this voice
was heard out of Paxe, that verie night that Christ suffered, in the
yeare of Tiberius the nineteenth. Surelie, this was a nierrie jest
devised by Thamus, who with some confederate thought to make sport
with the passengers, who were some asleepe, and some droonke, and
some other at plaie, &c: whiles the first voice was used. And at
the second voice, to wit, when he should deliver his message, he
being an old pilot, knew where some noise was usuall, by meanes
of some eccho in the sea, and thought he would (to the astonish-
ment of them) accomplish his devise, if the wether prooved calme.
Whereby may appeare, that he would in other cases of tempests,
&c: rather attend to more serious busines, than to that ridiculous
matter. For whie else should he not doo his errand in rough
wether, as well as in calme ? Or what need he tell the divell
thereof, when the divell told it him before, and with much more ex-
pedition could have done the errand himselfe?

* But you shall read in the Legend a fable, an oracle I would saie,
more authentike. For many will say that this was a prophane storie,
and not so canonicall as those which are vei'efied by the popes autho-
ritie : and thus it is written. A woman in hir travell sent hir sister to
Diana, which was the divell in an idoll (as all those oracles are said
to be) and willed hir to make hir praiers, or rather a request, to knowe
of hir safe deliverie : which thing she did. But the divell answered ;
Why praiest thou to me 1 I cannot helpe thee, but go praie to
Andrew the apostle, and he may helpe thy sister, &c. Lo, this was
not onelie a gentle, but a godlie divell, pittieng the womans case,
who revealing his owne disabilitie, enabled S. Andrew more. I
knowe some protestants will saie, that the divell, to mainteine idola-
trie, &c: referred the maid to S. Andrew. But what answer will the
papists make, who thinke it great pietie to praie unto saints, and so
by consequence honest courtesie in the divell, to send hir to S.
Andretv, who wold not faile to serve hir turne, &c.

HE opinions of the fathers, that oracles are ceased by the

historicB. Finallie, Athanasius concludes, that in times past there
were oracles in Delphos, Bceotia, Lycia, and other places : but
now since Christ is preached to all men, this madnesse is
ceased. So as you see, that whatsoever estimation in times
past, the ancient fathers conceived (by heeresaie) of those mira-
culous matters of idols and oracles, &c : they themselves refuse
now, not onelie to beare witnesse of; but also affirme, that ever
since Christs comming their mouthes have beene stopped. 

For the ceasing of the knaveries and cousening devises of preests,
I see no authoritie of scripture or ancient father, but rather the con-
trarie ; to wit, that there shall be strange illusions shewed by them,
even till the end. And truelie, whosoever knoweth and noteth the
order and devises of and in popish pilgrimages, shall see both the
oracles & their conclusions remaining, and as it were transferred
from Delphos to Rome, where that adulterous generation continuallie
seeketh a signe, though they have Moses &. the prophets, yea even
Christ & his apostles also, &c.

made their confederacies aforehand, to beguile the world, to gaine
monie, and to adde credit to their profession. This practise began

(they saie) could speake. And this was doone by a knave in a ^j l^ier u i.
hollowe tree, that seemed sound unto the simple people. This wood de pras. dam.
was in Molosstts a part of Greece., called Epyrics, and it was named
Dodonas oracles. There were manie oracles in Aegypt ; namelie, of
Hercules., oi Apollo., of Minerva, of Diana, of Mars, oi Jupiter, and
of the oxe Apys, who was the sonne of Jupiter, but his image was
worshipped in the likenesse of an oxe. Latona, who was the mother
of Apollo, was an oracle in the citie of Bute. The preests of Apollo,
who alwaies counterfaited furie and madnesse, gave oracles in the
temple called Clarius,\\\\.h.\n the citie of Colophon in Greece. At Thebes
in Bceotia and also in Lcebadia, Trophonius was the cheefe oracle.
At Memphis a cow, at Corinth an oxe called Mitieus, in Arsinoe a
crocodile, in Athens a prophet called Ainphiaraus, who  indeed 166.
died at Thebes, where they saie the earth opened, & swallowed him
up quicke. At Delphos was the great temple of Apollo, where
divels gave oracles by maides (as some saie) though indeed it was
doone by preests. It was built upon Parnassus hill in Greece.
And the defenders of oracles saie, that even as rivers oftentimes
are diverted to another course ; so likewise the spirit, which in-
spired the cheefe prophets, may for a time be silent, and revive
againe by revolution.

Demetrius saith, that the spirits, which attended on oracles, waxed
wearie of the peoples curiositie and importunitie, and for shame for-
sooke the temple. But as *one that of late hath written against *H. Haw. in
prophesies saith ; It is no marvell, that when the familiars that sathea-"'
speake in trunks were repelled from their harbour for feare of dis- gainst pro-
coverie, the blocks almightie lost their senses. For these are all
gone now, and their knaverie is espied ; so as they can no longer
abuse the world with such babies. But whereas  these great doctors 122.
suppose, that the cause of their dispatch was the comming of Christ ;
if they meane that the divell died, so soone as he was borne, or that
then he gave over his occupation: they are deceived. For the popish
church hath made a continuall practise hereof, partlie for their owne
private profit, lucre, and gaine ; and partly to be had in estimation
of the world, and in admiration among the simple. But indeed,
men that have learned Christ, and beene conversant in his word,
have discovered and shaken off the vanitie and abhomination
heereof. But if those doctors had lived till this daie, they would
have said and written, that oracles had ceased, or rather beene driven

The first Chapter.

The Hcbrue word Kasam expounded, and how far re a Christian
may conjecture of thiftgs to come.

lASAM (as fohn Wierus upon his owne knowledge
affirmeth, and upon the word of A7idrceas Masius re-
porteth) differeth little in signification from the former
word Ob: betokening Vaticinari, which is, To prophesie,
and is most commonlie taken in evill part ; as in Deut. \Z. ferent. 27.
&c: howbeit, sometime in good part, as in Esaie 3. verse. 2. To
foretell things to come upon probable conjectures, so as therein we
reach no further than becommeth humane capacitie, is not (in mine
opinion) unlawfull, but rather a commendable manifestation of wise-
dome and judgment, the good gifts and notable blessings of GOD,
for the which we ought to be thankfull ; as also to yeeld due honour
and praise unto him, for the noble order which he hath appointed in
nature : praieng him to lighten our hearts with the beames of his
wisedome, that we may more and more profit in the true knowledge
of the workemanship of his hands. But some are so nise, that they
condemne generallie all sorts of divinations, denieng those things
that in nature have manifest causes, and are so framed, as they for-
shew things to come, and in that shew admonish us of things after to
insue, exhibiting signes of unknowne and future matters to be judged
upon, by the order, lawe, and course of nature  proposed unto us by
God.

And some on the other side are so bewitched with follie, as they
attribute to creatures that estimation, which rightlie and truelie
apperteineth to God the creator of all things ; affirming that the
publike and private destinies of all humane matters, and whatsoever
a man would knowe of things come or gone, is manifested to us in the
heavens : so as by the starres and planets all things might be
knowne. These would also, that nothing should be taken in hand or
gone about, without the favourable aspect of the planets. By which,
and other the like devises they deprave and prophane the ancient and
commendable observations of our forfathers : as did Colebrasus, who
taught, that all mans life was governed by the seven planets ; and
yet a christian, and condemned for heresie. But let us so farre foorth
imbrace and allow this philosophie and prophesieng, as the word of
God giveth us leave, and commendeth the same unto us.

The second Chapter.

Proofes by the old and iietu testament., that certaine observations
of the weather are lawfull.

[hen God by his word and wisedome had made the
heavens, and placed the starres in the firmament, he
said ; Let them be for signes, and for seasons, and for
daies, and yeares. When he created the rainebowe in
the clouds, he said it should be for a signe and token unto us.
Which we find true, not onelie of the floud past, but also of shewers
to come. And therefore according to Jesus Sirachs advise, let us
behold it, and praise him that made it. The prophet David saith ;
The heavens declare the gloria of God, and the firmament sheweth
his handie worke : daie unto daie uttereth the same, and night unto
night teacheth knowledge. It is also written that by the commandement
of the holie one the starres are placed, and continue in their order, &
faile not in their watch. It should appeare, that Christ himselfe did not
altogither neglect the course & order of the heavens, in that he said ;
When you see a cloud rise out of the west, streight waie you saie a
shewer commeth : and so it is. And when you see the southwind
blowe ; you saie it will be hot, and so it commeth to passe. Againe,
when it is evening, you saie faire* weather, for the skie is red : and
in the morning you saie, to daie shalbe a tempest, for the skie is red
and lowring. Wherein as he noteth that these things doo trulie come
to passe, according to ancient observation, and to the rule astro-
nomicall : so doth he also by other words following admonish us,
that in attending too much to those obsevations, we neglect not
speciallie to follow our christian vocation.

The physician is commended unto us, and allowed in the scriptures :
but so to put trust in him, as to neglect & distrust God, is severelie
forbidden and reproved. Surelie it is most necessarie for us to know
and observe diverse rules astrologicall ; otherwise we could not with
oportunitie dispatch our ordinarie affaires. And yet Lactantiiis con-
demneth and recounteth it among the number of witchcrafts : from
whose censure Calvine doth not much varie. The poore husbandman
perceiveth that the increase of the moone maketh plants and living
creatures frutefull : so as in the full moone they are in best strength,
decaieng in the wane, and in the conjunction doo utterlie wither
and vade. Which when by observation, use and practise they
have once learned, they distribute their businesse accordinglie ; as
their times and seasons to sowe, to plant, to proine, to let their cattell
bloud, to cut, &c.

The third Chapter.

That cerfeine observations are indifferent, certeine ridiculous, and
certeine impious, whence that cunning is derived of Apollo, and
of Aruspices.

KNOW not whether to disallow or discommend the
curious observation used by our elders, who conjectured
upon nativities : so as, if Saturne and Mercurie were
opposite in anie brute signe, a man then borne should be
dumbe or stammer much ; whereas it is dailie scene, that children
naturallie imitate their parents conditions in that behalfe. Also they
have noted, that one borne in the spring of the moone, shalbe
healthie ; in that time of the wane, when the moone is utterlie decaied,
the child then borne cannot live ; and in the conjunction, it cannot
long continue.

But I am sure the opinion of Julius Matermis is most impious,
who writeth, that he which is borne when Saturne is in Leone, shall
live long, and after his death shall go to heaven presentlie. And so
is this oi Albumasar, who saith, that whosoever praieth to God, when
the moone is in Capite draconis, shalbe heard, and obteine his praier.
Furthermore, to plaie the cold prophet, as to recount it good or bad
lucke, when salt or wine falleth on the table, or is shed, &c : or to
prognosticate that ghests approch to your house, upon the chattering
of pies or haggisters, wherof there can be yeelded no probable
reason, is altogither vanitie and superstition : as hereafter shalbe
more largelie shewed. But to make simple people beleeve, that a
man or woman can foretell good or evill fortune, is meere witchcraft
or cousenage. For God is the onlie searcher of the heart, and de-
livereth not his counsell to so lewd reprobates. I know diverse
writers afifirme, that witches foretell things, as prompted by a reall
divell ; and that he againe learneth it out of the prophesies written in
the scriptures, and by other nimble sleights, wherein he passeth anie
other creature earthlie ; and that the same divell, or some of his
fellowes runnes or flies as farre as Rochester, to mother Bungle ; or to
Catiturburie to M. T ; or to Delphos, to Apollo ; or to Aesculapius,
in Pargamo ; or to some other idoU or witch, and there by waie of
oracle answers all questions, through his understanding of the pro-
phesies conteined in the old testament, especiallie in Daniel and
Esaie : whereby the divell knew of the translation of the monarchie
from Babylon to Grcecia, &c. But either they have learned this of
some oracle or witch ; or else I know not where the divell they find it.

Of the idoll called Apollo, I have somewhat alreadie spoken in

hath not promised to anie of his angels, or elect people. For it is
said, that if Apollo were in a chafe, he would sweat : if he had
remorse to the afflicted, and could not help them, he would shed
teares, which I beleeve might have beene wiped awaie with that
handkerchiefe, that wiped and dried the Rood of graces face, being
in like perplexities. Even as another sort of witching priests called
Aruspices, prophesied victorie to Alexander, bicause an eagle lighted
on his head : which eagle might (I beleeve) be cooped or caged with
MaJwmets dove, that picked peason out of his eare.

The predictions of soothsaiers and lewd priests, the prognostications
of astro7iomers and physicians allowable, divine prophesies holie
and good.

I HE cousening tricks of oracling priests and monkes, are
and have beene speciallie most abhominable. The super-
stitious observations of sensles augurors and soothsaiers
(contrarie to philosophie, and without authoritie of scrip-
ture) are verie ungodlie and ridiculous. Howbeit, I reject not the
prognostications of astronomers, nor the conjectures or forewarnings
of physicians, nor yet the interpretations of philosophers ; although
in respect of the divine prophesies conteined in holie scriptures, they
are not to be weighed or regarded. For the end of these and the
other is not onlie farre differing ; but whereas these conteine onlie
the word and will of God, with the other are mingled most horrible
lies and cousenages. For though there may be many of them learned
and godlie, yet lurke there in corners of the same profession, a great
number of counterfets and couseners. f. Bodin putteth this differ-
ence betweene divine prophets and inchantors ; to wit, the one saith
alwaies true, the others words (proceeding from the divell) are
alwaies false ; or for one truth they tell a hundred lies. And then

The diversitie of trice prophets^ of Urim, and of the propheticall
use of the twelve precious stones cofttetned therein, of the divine
voice called Eccho.

T should appeare, that even of holie prophets there were
diverse sorts. For David and Salomon, although in
their psalmes and parables are conteined most excellent
mysteries, and notable allegories : yet they were not indued Diverse de-
with that degree of prophesie, that Elie and Elisha were, &c. For as prophesie. 127.
often as it is said, that God spake to David or Salomon, it is meant
to be done by the prophets. For Nathan or Gad were the messengers
and prophets to reveale Gods will to David. And Ahiam the Silo- 2. Reg. 2.
nite was sent from God to Salomon. Item, the spirit of prophesie,
which Elias had, was doubled upon Elisha. Also some prophets
prophesied all their lives, some had but one vision, and some had
more, according to Gods pleasure ; yea some prophesied unto the
people of such things as came not to passe, and that was where Gods
wrath was pacified by repentance. But these prophets were alwaies
reputed among the people to be wise and godlie ; whereas the heathen
prophets were evermore knowne and said to be mad and foolish : as
it is written both of the prophets oi Sibylla, and also oi Apollo ; and
at this daie also in the Indies, Slc.

Of prophesies cottditiojiall : whereof the prophesies in the old
testamefit doo intreate^ and by whom they were pjiblishedj witch-
mongers aunswers to the objections against witches stpernaturall
actions.

HRIST and his apostles prophesied of the calamities and
afflictions, which shall greeve and disturbe the church of
God in this life : also of the last dale, and of the signes
and tokens that shall be shewed before that dale : and
finallie of all things, which are requisite for us to foreknowe. How-
beit, such is the mercie of God, that all prophesies, threatnings,
plagues, and punishments are annexed to conditions of repentance :
as on the other side, corporall blessings are tied under the condition
of the crosse and castigation. So as by them the mysteries af our
salvation being discovered unto us, we are not to seeke new signes and
miracles ; but to attend to the doctrine of the apostles, who preached
Christ exhibited and crucified for our sinnes, his resurrection, ascen-
sion, and thereby the redemption of as manie as beleeve, &c.

The prophesies in the old testament treat of the continuance, the
governement, and the difference of estates : of the distinction of the
foure monarchies, of their order, decaie, and instauration ; of the
changes and ruines of the kingdomes oi fuda, Israel, Aegypt, Persia,
Grcscia, Gr'c : and speciallie of the comming of our Saviour Jesus
Christ ; and how he should be borne of a virgine, and where, of his
tribe, passion, resurrection, &c. These prophesies were published
by Gods speciall and peculiar prophets, endued with his particular
and excellent gifts, according to his promise ; I will raise them up a
prophet out of the midst of their brethren, I will put my words in his
mouth, &c. Which though it were speciallie spoken of Christ, yet
was it also spoken of those particular prophets, which were placed
among them by God to declare his will ; which were also figures of
Christ the prophet himselfe. Now, if prophesie be an extraordinarie
gift of God, and a thing peculiar to himselfe, as without whose speciall
assistance no creature can be a prophet, or shew what is to come ;
whie should we beleeve, that those lewd persons can performe by
divinations and miracles that wliich is not in humane but in divine
power to accomplish .-'

Howbeit, when I denie that witches can ride in the aire, and the
miraculous circumstance thereof: by and by it is objected unto me,
that Enoch and Elie were rapt into heaven bodilie ; and that Abactike



of Witchcraft. chap. 7. 141

was carried in the aire, to feed Daniel : and so falselie oppose a divels
or a witches power against the vertue of the Holy-ghost. If I deride
the poets opinions, saieng, that witches cannot Caelo dediicere Ittnain,
fetch the moone from heaven, &c: they tell me that at Josnias battell
the sunne staied, and at the passion of Christ there was palpable
darknes. If I denie their cunning in the exposition of dreames, ad-
vising them to remember Jereinles counsell, not to followe or credit
the expositors of dreames ; they hit me in the teeth with Daniel and
Joseph : for that the one of them expounded Pharao the Persian
kings, the other Nabuchadnez-zar the Aegyptia7i kings dreame. If I
saie with Salomon^ that the dead knowe nothing, and that the Eccles. 9, 5.
dead knowe us not, neither are remooveable out of Abrahams
bosome, &c : they produce the storie of Saimiel : wherein, I saie, i. Sam. j8.
they set the power of a creature as high as the creator. If I saie,
that these witches cannot transubstantiate themselves, nor others
into beasts, &c. they cite the storie of Nabuchad7iez-xar ; as though
indeed he were made a materiall beast, and that also by witch-
craft ; and strengthen that their assertion with the fables of Circe and j.
Ulysses his companions, &c.

The seventh Chapter.

What were the miracles expressed in the old testament, and what
are they in the new testajnent : a7id that we are 7iot fioiu to looke
for anie jnore miracles.

HE miracles expressed in the old testament were manie,
but the end of them all was one, though they were divers
and differing in shew : as where the sacrifices of Moses,
Elias, and Salomon, being abundantlie wet were burnt
with fier from heaven, &c. The varietie of toongs at the building of Gen. 11,6.
Babylon, Isaachs birth of Sarah being by nature past children, the ^an' "i". 129.
passage through the red sea, Daniels foretelling of the foure
monarchies, in the fourth whereof he apparantlie foresheweth the
comming of the Lord. All these, and manie other, which are expressed
in the old testament, were mercifull instructions and notable miracles
to strengthen the faith of Gods people in their Messias. If you had
gone to Delphos, Apollo would have made you beleeve with his
amphibologicall answers, that he could have foretold you all these
things.

The miracles wrought by Christ were the raising up of the dead a summe
(which manie would impute to the woman of Endor, and also to our ^i^j'jJe's''
witches and conjurors) the restoring of the lame to lims, the blind to




142 Q. Booke. The discove7'ie

sight, the dumbe to speach, and finallie the healing of all diseases ;
which manie beleeve our witches can doo ; yea, and as they them-
selves will take it upon them. As for casting out of divels (which
was another kind of miracles usuall with Christ) witches and con-
jurors are said to be as good thereat as ever he was : and yet, if you
will beleeve Christs words, it cannot be so. For he saith ; Everie
Matt. ij. 35. kingdome divided against it selfe, shall be brought to naught, &c. If

sathan cast out sathan, he is divided, &c : and his kingdome shall not
endure, &c.

miracles, and manie more, and all to confirme his truth, and strengthen
our faith, and finallie for the conversion of the people (as appeareth
in John. 6. 7, and 12 : in so much as he vehementlie reprooved such,

Tyre and Sidon, which have beene doone in you, they had a great while

beleeving all his wonderous works, let us reject these old wives fables,
as lieng vanities : whereof you may find in the golden legend, Af. Mai.
and speciallie in Bodin miraculous stuffe, enough to checke all the
miracles expressed in the old and new testament ; which are of more
credit with manie bewitched people, than the true miracles of
Christ himselfe. Insomuch as they stand in more awe

them not : for by them the physicians manie times doo understand
the state of their patients bodies. For some of them come by meanes
of choler, flegme, melanchoHe, or bloud ; and some by love, surfet,
hunger, thirst, &c. Gallen and Boetius were said to deale with
divels, bicause they told so justlie their patients dreames, or rather
by their dreames their speciall diseases. Howbeit, physicall dreames
are natural!, and the cause of them dwelleth in the nature of man.
For they are the inward actions of the mind in the spirits of the
braine, whilest the bodie is occupied with sleepe : for as touching
the mind it selfe, it never sleepeth. These dreames varie, according
to the difference of humors and vapors. There are also casuall
dreames, which (as Salomon saith) come through the multitude of
businesse. For as a looking glasse sheweth the image or figure there-
unto opposite : so in dreames, the phantasie & imagination informes
the understanding of such things as haunt the outward sense.
Whereupon the poet saith :

Soiimia tie cures, nam mens humana quod optai,
Dmn vigilat sperans,per somtium cernit id ipsum :

Regard no dreames, for why the mitid
Of that in sleepe a view dooth take.

The fourth Chapter.

Against interpreters of dreanies, of the or dinar ie cause of dreanies^
Heviingius his opinion of diabolicall dreaines, the interpretation
of dreames ceased.

HERE are bookes carried about concerning this matter,
under the name oi Abraham, who (as Philo In lib. gigan-
tiini saith) was the first inventor of the exposition of
dreames : and so likewise of Salomon and Daniel. But
Cicero In lib. dc divinatiotte confuteth the vanitie and follie of them
that give credit to dreames. And as for the interpretors of dreames,
as they knowe not before the dreame, nor yet after, any certeintie ;
yet when any thing afterwards happeneth, then they applie the dreame
to that which hath chanced.

Certeinlie men never lightHe faile to dreame by night, of that which
they meditate by daie : and by daie they see divers and sundrie
things, and conceive them severalHe in their minds. Then those
mixed conceits being laid up in the closset of the memorie, strive
togither; which, bicause the phantasie cannot discerne nor discusse,
some certeine thing gathered of manie conceits is bred and contrived
in one togither. And therefore in mine opinion, it is time vainelie
emploied, to studie about the interpretation of dreames. He that list
to see the follie and vanitie thereof, maie read a vaine treatise, set
out by Thomas Hill Londoner, 1568.

Lastlie, there are diabolicall dreames, which Nicolaus Hemingius
divideth into three sortes. The first is, when the divell immediatlie
of himselfe (he meaneth corporallie) offereth anie matter of dreame.
Secondlie, when the divell sheweth revelations to them that have
made request unto him therefore. Thirdlie, when magicians by art
bring to passe, that other men dreame what they will. Assuredlie
these, and so all the rest (as they maie be used) are verie magicall
and divelish dreames. For although we maie receive comfort of
mind by those, which are called divine dreames, and health of bodie
through physicall dreames : yet if we take upon us to use the office of
God in the revelation or rather the interpretation of them ; or if we
attribute unto them miraculous effects (now when we see the gifts of
prophesie, and of interpretation of dreames, and also the operation of
miracles are ceased, which were speciall and peculiar gifts of God, to
confirme the truth of the word, and to establish his people in the faith
of the Messias, who is now exhibited unto us both in the testament,
and also in the bloud of our Saviour Jesus Christ) we are bewitched,

That neither witches, nor anie other, can either by words or hearts,
ihnist into the mind of a sleepi7i_s; man, what cogitations or
dreames they list ; and whence jnagicall df-eames come.

GRANT there maie be hearbs and stones found and
kno'.vne to the physicians, which maie procure dreames ;
and other hearbs and stones, &c : to make one bewraie
all the secrets of his mind, when his bodie sleepeth, or at
least wise to procure speech in sleepe. But that witches or magicians
have power by words, herbs, or imprecations to thrust into the mind
or conscience of man, what it shall please them, by vertue of their
charmes, hearbs, stones, or familiars, &c : according to the opinion ,
of Hemingiiis, I denie : though therewithal! I confesse, that the
divell both by daie and also by night, travelleth to seduce man, and
to lead him from God ; yea and that no waie more than this, where
he placeth himselfe as God in the minds of them that are so cre-
dulous, to attribute unto him, or unto witches, that which is onlie in
the office, nature, and power of God to accomplish.

Doth not Daniel the prophet saie, even in this case ; It is the
182. Lord onelie that knovi^eth such secrets, as in the exposition of dreames
is required ? And doth not Joseph repeat those verie words to Pharaos
officers, who consulted with him therein .-' Examples of divine
dreames you maie find a great number in the scripture, such (I
meane) as it pleased God to reveale his pleasure by. Of physicall
dreames we maie both read in authors, and see in our owne experi-
ence dailie, or rather nightly. Such dreams also as are casuall, they
are likewise usuall, and come (as hath beene said) through the multi-
tude of affaires and businesse. Those which in these dales are
called magicall or diabolicall dreames, maie rather be called melan-
cholicall. For out of that blacke vapor in sleepe, through dreames,
appeareth (as Aristotle saith) some horrible thing ; and as it were the
image of an ouglie divell : sometimes also other terrible visions,
imaginations, counsels, and practises. As where we read of a cer-
teine man, that dreamed there appeared one unto him that required
him to throwe himselfe into a deepe pit, and that he should reape
great benefit thereby at Gods hands. So as the miserable wretch
giving credit thereunto, performed the matter, and killed himselfe.

ointment greatlie to this purpose, rehearsed by the fore-
said John Bapt. Neap, wherein although he male be
overtaken and cousened by an old witch, and made not
onelie to beleeve, but also to report a false tale ; yet bicause it
greatlie overthroweth the opinion of M. Mai. Bodin, and such other,

will set downe his words in this behalfe. The receipt is as followeth.

such youthes as they love and desire most : for the force (saith he) ot
their imagination is so vehement, that almost all that part of the
braine, wherein the memorie consisteth, is full of such conceipts.

they receive such impressions and stedfast imaginations into their

them. This (saith he) will not so come to passe with everie one, but
onlie with old women that are melancholike, whose nature is extreame
cold, and their evaporation small ; and they both perceive and

The ninth Chapter.

A confutation of the former follies, as well concerning ointments,
dreames, &^c. as also of the assemblie of witches, and of their con-
sultations and bankets at sundrie places, and all in dreames.

lUT if it be true that S. Augustine saith, and manie other
writers, that witches nightwalkings are but phantasies
and dreames : then all the reportes of their bargaine,
I transporting, and meetings with Diana, Minerva, &c :
are but fables ; and then do they lie that mainteine those actions to
be doone in deed and veritie, which in truth are doone no waie. It
were marvell on the one side (if those things happened in dreames,
which neverthelesse the witches affirme to be otherwise) that when
those witches awake, they neither consider nor remember that they
were in a dreame. It were marvell that their ointments, by the
physicians opinions having no force at all to that effect, as they con-
fesse which are inquisitors, should have such operation. It were
marvell that their ointments cannot be found anie where, saving onelie
in the inquisitors bookes. It were marvell, that when a stranger is
annointed therewith, they have sometimes, and yet not alwaies, the
like operation as with witches ; which all the inquisitors confesse.

But to this last, frier Bartholo»iceHS saith, that the witches them-
selves, before they annoint themselves, do heare in the night time a
great noise of minstrels, which flie over them, with the ladie of the
fairies, and then they addresse themselves to their journie. But then
I marvell againe, that no bodie else heareth nor seeth this troope of
minstrels, especiallie riding in a moone light night. It is marvell
that they that thinke this to be but in a dreame, can be persuaded
that all the rest is anie other than dreames. It is marvell that in
dreames, witches of old acquaintance meet so just togither, and con-
clude upon murthers, and receive ointments, roots, powders, &c : (as
witchmongers report they doo, and as they make the witches confesse)
and yet lie at home fast asleepe. It is marvell that such preparation
is made for them (as Sprenger, Bartholomezv, and Bodm report) as
well in noble mens houses, as in alehouses ; and that they come in
dreames, and eate up their meate : and the alewife speciallie is not
wearied with them for non paiment of their score, or false paiment ;
to wit, with imaginarie monie, which they saie is not substantial!, and
that they talke not afterwards about the reckoning, and so discover
the matter. And it is most marvell of all, that the hostesse, &c: dooth
not sit among them, and take part of their good cheere. For so it is,
that if any part of these their meetings and league be true, it is as
true and as certeinlie prooved and confessed, that at some alehouse,
or sometime at some Gentlemans house, there is continual! pre-
paration made monethlie for this assemblie : as appeereth in S.

JT is held and mainteined by divers, and gathered out of
the 12. oi Numbers, that all which was written or spoken
by the prophets, among the children of Israel {Moses ex-

it is manifest, that manie things, which are thought by the unlearned
to have beene reallie finished, have beene onlie performed by dreams
and visions. As where Salomon required of God the gift of wis-

promise of the continuance of the kingdome of Israel in his line. So

if we expect revelations in our dreames, now, when Christ is come,
we shall deceive our selves : for in him are fulfilled all dreames and

the king of the Thebans is said to be the first inventor : but Tages

first published the discipline thereof, being but a little boie ; as Cicero

reporteth out of the bookes of the Hetruscans themselves. Some

points of this art are more high and profound than some others, and

yet are they more homelie and slovenlie than the rest ; as namelie,

the divination upon the entrailes of beasts, which the Gentiles in

their sacrifices speciallie observed. Insomuch as Marcus Varro,

seeing the absurditie thereof, said that these gods were not onlie idle,

but verie slovens, that used so to hide their secrets and counsels in

the guts and bowels of beasts.

How vainlie, absurdlie, and superstitiouslie the heathen used this

kind of divination in their sacrifices, is manifested by their actions

& ceremonies in that behalfe practised, as well in times past, as at

this houre. The Aegyptians had 666. severall sorts and kinds of

jgo. sacrifices ; the Ronia7is had almost as manie ; the Grcejcians had not

so few as they ; the Persians and the Medes were not behind them ;

the Indies and other nations have at this instant their sacrifices full

of varietie, and more full of barbarous impietie. For in sundrie

places, these offer sacrifices to the divell, hoping thereby to moove

him to lenitie : yea, these commonlie sacrifice such of

their enimies, as they have taken in warre : as

we read that the Gentiles in ancient time

did offer sacrifice, to appease the

wrath and indignation of

their feigned

The superstition of the heathen about the element of fier, and how it

that they had some inklittg of the godlie fathers dooings in that
behalfe.

|S touching the element of fier, & the superstition therof
about those businesses, you shall understand, that manie
superstitious people and nations have received, reverenced,
& reserved fier, as the most holy thing among their sacri-
insomuch (I saie) as they have worshipped it among their
gods, calling it Oriinasda (to wit) holie fier, and divine light. The
Greekes called it ealai', the Romans Vesta, which is, The fier of the
Lord. Surelie they had heard of the fier that came downe from
heaven, and consumed the oblations of the fathers ; and they under-
stood it to be God himselfe. For there came to the heathen, the
bare names of things, from the doctrine of the godlie fathers and
patriarchs, and those so obscured with fables, and corrupted with
lies, so overwhelmed with superstitions, and disguised with ceremonies,
that it is hard to judge from whence they came. Some cause thereof
(I suppose) was partlie the translations of governements, whereby
one nation learned follie of another ; and partlie blind devotion,
without knowledge of Gods word : but speciallie the want of grace,
which they sought not for, according to Gods commandement and
will. And that the Gentiles had some inkling of the godlie fathers
dooings, may diverslie appeare. Doo not the Muscovits and *Indian

Of the Romane sacrifices : of the estimation they had of atgurie, of
the lawe of the twelve tables.

HE Romans, even after they were growne to great
civilitie, and enjoied a most flourishing state and com-
monwealth, would sometimes sacrifice themselves, some-
times their children, sometimes their friends, &c : consum-
ing the same with fier, which they thought holie. Such estimation
(I saie) was attributed to this art of divination upon the entrails of
beasts, &c : at Rome, as the cheefe princes themselves exercised the
same ; namelie, Romithis, Fabius MaxiniKs, Qr'c : in so much as rgj.
there was a decree made there, by the whole senate, that six of the
cheefe magistrats sonnes should from time to time be put foorth, to
learne the mysterie of these arts of augurie and divination, at Hetru-
ria, where the cunning and knowledge thereof most abounded.
When they came home well informed and instructed in this art, their
estimation and dignitie was such, as they were accounted, reputed,
and taken to be the interpretors of the gods, or rather betweene the
gods and them. No high preest, nor anie other great officer was
elected, but these did either absolutelie nominate them, or else did
exhibit the names of two, whereof the senate must choose the one.

In their ancient lawes were written these words: Prodigia &r' The lawe

and portentous matters be carried to the soothsaiers of Hetruria,

at the will and commandement of the senat ; and let the yoong

princes be sent to Hetruria, there to learne that discipline, or to be

instructed in that art and knowledge. Let there be alvvaies some

solicitor, to learne with what gods they have decreed or determined

their matters, and let sacrifices be made unto them in times

of lightening, or at anie strange or supernaturall

shew. Let all such conjecturing tokens be

observed ; whatsoever the sooth-

saier commandeth, let it

Colleges of angtirors, their office, their member, the signification of

profession, their places of exercise, their apparrell, their supersti-
tion.

lOMULUS erected three colleges or centuries of those
kinds of soothsaiers, which onehe (and none other) should
have authoritie to expound the minds and admonish-
ments of the gods. Afterwards that number was aug-
mented to five, and after that to nine : for they must needs be od.
In the end, they increased so fast, that they were feine to make a
decree for staie from the further proceeding in those erections : hke
to our statute of Mortinaine. Howbeit, Silla (contrarie to all orders
and constitutions before made) increased that number to foure and
twentie.

And though Atiguriuni be most properlie that divination, which is
gathered by birds ; yet bicause this word Nahas comprehendeth all
other kinds of divination, as Extispicittm, artispicium, &^c : which is
as well the ghessing upon the entrailes of beasts, as divers other
waies : omitting physiognomie and palmestrie, and such like, for the
tediousnes and follie thereof; I will speake a little of such arts, as
were above measure regarded of our elders : neither mind I to dis-
cover the whole circumstance, but to refute the vanitie thereof, and
speciallie of the professors of them, which are and alwaies have beene
cousening arts, and in them conteined both speciall and severall
kinds of witchcrafts. For the maisters of these faculties have ever
taken upon them to occupie the place and name of God ; blasphem-
ouslie ascribing unto themselves his omnipotent power, to foretell, (S:c :
whei'eas, in truth, they could or can doo nothing, but make a shew of
that which is not.

One matter, to bewraie their cousening, is ; that they could never
worke nor foreshew anie thing to the poore or inferior sort of people :
for portentous shewes (saie they) alwaies concerned great estates.
Such matters as touched the baser sort, were inferior causes ;
which the superstition of the people themselves would not neglect
to learne. Howbeit, the professors of this art descended not so
lowe, as to communicate with them : for they were preests (which in
all ages and nations have beene jollie fellowes) whose office was, to
tell what should come to passe, either touching good lucke, or bad
fortune ; to expound the minds, admonitions, warnings and threat-

nings of the gods, to foreshew calamities, &c : which might be (by
their sacrifices and common contrition) remooved and qualified. And
before their entrance into that action, they had manie observations,
which they executed verie superstitiouslie ; pretending that everie
bird and beast, &c, should be sent from the gods as foreshewes of
somewhat. And therefore first they used to choose a cleare daie, and IQS-
faire wether to doo their busines in : for the which their place was
certeinelie assigned, as well in Rome as in Hetruria^ wherein they
observed everie quarter of the element, which waie to looke, and
which way to stand, &c. Their apparell was verie preestlike, of 142.

ing the outward parts, it was alwaies provided and foreseene, that

and notes to be taken of the externall actions of those beasts, at the
time of sacrifice : as if they would not quietlie be brought to the
place of execution, but must be forceablie hailed ; or if they brake
loose ; or if by hap, cunning, or strength they withstood the first
blowe ; or if after the butchers blowe, they leaped up, rored, stood
fast ; or being fallen, kicked, or would not quietlie die, or bled not
well; or if anie ill newes had beene heard, or anie ill sight scene at
the time of slaughter or sacrifice : which were all significations of ill
lucke and unhappie successe. On the other side, if the slaughterman
performed his office well, so as the beast had beene well chosen, not
infected, but whole and sound, and in the end faire killed ; all had
beene safe : for then the gods smiled.

other divinations more vaine and foolish. Howbeit, Plato thinketh
a commonwealth cannot stand without this art, and numbereth it
among the liberall sciences. These fellowes promised Pompeie,
Cassius, and Ccesar, that none of them should die before they were
old, and that in their ovvne houses, and in great honor ; and yet they
all died cleane contrarilie. Howbeit doubtles, the heathen in this
point were not so much to be blamed, as the sacrificing papists : for
they were directed hereunto without the knowledge of Gods promises ;
neither knew they the end why such ceremonies and sacrifices were
instituted ; but onelie understood by an uncerteine and slender re-
port, that God was woont to send good or ill successe to the children
of Israeli, and to the old patriarchs and fathers, upon his acceptance
or disallowance of their sacrifices and oblations. But men in all ages
have beene so desirous to know the effect of their purposes, the

The cousening art of sortilege or lotarie, practised especiallie by Aegyp-

HE counterfeit Aegyptians, which were indeed cousening
vagabonds, practising the art called Sortilegitan, had no
small credit among the multitude : howbeit, their divi-
nations were as was their fast and loose, and as the
witches cures and hurtes, & as the soothsaiers answers, and as the
conjurors raisings up of spirits, and as Apollos or the Rood of graces
oracles, and as the jugglers knacks of legierdemaine, and as the
papists exorcismes, and as the witches charmes, and as the counter-
feit visions, and as the couseners knaveries. Hereupon it was said ;
No7i i7ivelniatHr ititer vos 7iienahas, that is Sortilegus, which were like
to these Aegyptian couseners. As for other lots, they were used, and
that lawfullie ; as appeareth hy Jonas a.nd. others that were holie men,
and as may be seene among all commonwelths, for the deciding of
diverse controversies, &c ; wherein thy neighbour is not misused, nor
God anie waie offended. But in truth 1 thinke, bicause of the cou-
senage that so easilie may be used herein, God forbad it in the
commonwealth of the Jewes, though in the good use thereof it was
allowed in matters of great weight ; as appeareth both in the old and
new testament ; and that as well in doubtfull cases and distributions,
as in elections and inheritances, and pacification of variances. I omit
to speake anie thing of the lots comprised in verses, concerning the
lucke ensuing, either of Virgil, Homer, or anie other, wherein fortune
is gathered by the sudden turning unto them : bicause it is a childish
and ridiculous toie, and like unto childrens plaie at Priimcs seamdus,
or the game called The philosophers table : but herein I will referre
you to the bable it selfe, or else to Bodin, or to some such sober writer
thereupon; of whome there is no want.

There is a lot also called Pythagoras lot, which (some saie) Ari-
stotle beleeved : and that is, where the characters of letters have
certeine proper numbers ; whereby they divine (through the proper
names of men) so as the numbers of each letters being gathered in
a summe, and put togither, give victorie to them whose summe is
the greater ; whether the question be of warre, life, matri-
monie, viclorie, &c : even as the unequall number of
vowels in proper names portendeth lacke of sight,
halting, &c : which the godfathers and god-
mothers might easilie prevent, if the
f"asc stood so.

ERE is place also for the Cabalisticall art, consisting
of unwritten verities, which the Jewes doo beleeve and
brag that God himselfe gave to Moses in the mount

igg. 'iKiHThfjJmpSHJ Sinai ; and afterwards was taught onelie with livelie
voice, by degrees of succession, without writing, untill the time
of Esdras : even as the scholers of Archippus did use wit and
memorie in steed of bookes. They divide this in twaine ; the one
expoundeth with philosophicall reason the secrets of the lawe and
the bible, wherein (they saie) that Salomon was verie cunning ;
bicause it is written in the Hebrew stories, that he disputed from the
Cedar of Liban!es,e.vQr\. to the Hisop, and also of birds, beasts, &c.
The other is as it were a symbolicall divinitie of the highest contem-
plation, of the divine and angelike vertues, of holie names and
signes ; wherein the letters, numbers, figures, things and armes, the
prickes over the letters, the lines, the points, and the accents doo all
signifie verie profound things and great secrets. By these arts the
Atheists suppose Moses wrote all his miracles, and that hereby
they have power over angels and divels, as also to doo miracles : yea
and that hereby all the miracles that either anie of the prophets, or
Christ himselfe wrought, were accomplished.

But C. Agrippa having searched to the bottome of this art, saith it
is nothing but superstition and foUie. Otherwise you male be sure
Christ would not have hidden it from his church. For this cause the

145. Jewes were so skilfull in the names of God. But there is none other
name in heaven or earth, in which we might be saved, but Jesus :
neither is that meant by his bare name, but by his vertue and good-
nes towards us. These Cabalists doo further brag, that they are able
hereby, not onelie to find out and know the unspeakeable mysteries of
God ; but also the secrets which are above scripture ; whereby also
they take upon them to prophesie, and to worke miracles : yea hereby
they can make what they list to be scripture ; as Valeria Proba did
picke certeine verses out of Virgil alluding them to Christ. And
therefore these their revolutions are nothing but allegoricall games,
which idle men busied in letters, points, and numbers (which the
Hebrew toong easilie suffereth) devise, to delude and cousen the
simple and ignorant. And this they call Alphabetarie or Arythman-
ticall divinitie, which Christ shewed to his apostles onelie, and which

this behalfe, who hath ; scrinio pectoris, not onelie the exposition of « condl.
all lawes, both divine and humane, but also authoritie to adde there-
unto, or to drawe backe therefrom at his pleasure : and this may he
lavvfullie doo even with the scriptures, either by addition or substrac-
tion, after his owne pontificall liking. As for example : he hath added
the Apocrypha (whereunto he might as well have joined S. Atigtistines [Cof Trent 1550]
works, or the course of the civill lawe, &c :) Againe, he hath dimin-
ished from the decalog or ten conimandements, not one or two words,
but a whole precept, namelie the second, which it hath pleased him
to dash out with his pen : and trulie he might as well by the same
authoritie have rased out of the testament S. Markes gospell.



The twelfe Chapter.

When, how, and in what sort sacrifices were first ordained, and
how they were propha7ied, and how the pope corriipieth the
sacraments of Christ.

liT the first God manifested to our father Adatn, by the Gen. 2. 17.
prohibition of the apple, that he would have man live
under a lawe, in obedience and submission ; and
not to wander like a beast without order or discip-
line. And after man had transgressed, and deserved thereby Gods Gen. 3. 6.
heavie displeasure ; yet his mercie prevailed ; and taking compassion Gen. 3. 15.
upon man, he promised the Messias, who should be borne of a
woman, and breake the serpents head : declaring by evident testi-
monies, that his pleasure was that man should be restored to favour
and grace, through Christ : and binding the minds of men to this
promise, and to be fixed upon their Messias, established figures and
ceremonies wherewith to nourish their faith, and confirmed the same
with miracles, prohibiting and excluding all mans devises in that
behalfe. And upon his promise renewed, he injoined (I say) and ^^^"- '-• 3-
erected a new forme of worship, whereby he would have his promises 146.
constantlie beheld, faithfullie beleeved, and reverentlie regarded. He
or deined six sorts of divine sacrifices ; three propitiatorie, not as 201.
meriting remission of sinnes, but as figures of Christs propitiation :
the other three were of thanksgiving. These sacrifices were full of
ceremonies, they were powdered with consecrated salt, and kindled

with fier, which was preserved in the tabernacle of the Lord : which
fier (some thinke) was sent downe from heaven. GOD himselfe
commanded these rites and ceremonies to our forefathers, Noah,
Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, &c : promising therein both the ampHfica-
tion of their families, and also their Messias. But in tract of time
(I saie) wantonnesse, negligence, and contempt, through the instiga-
tion of the divell, abolished this institution of GOD : so as in the
end, God himselfe was forgotten among them, and they became
pagans & heathens, devising their owne waies, untill everie countrie
had devised and erected both new sacrifices, and also new gods par-
ticular unto themselves. Whose example the pope foUoweth, in
prophaning of Christs sacraments, disguising them with his devises
and superstitious ceremonies ; contriving and comprehending therein
the follie of all nations : the which bicause little children doo now
perceive and scorne, I will passe over ; and returne to the Gentiles,
whome I cannot excuse of cousenage, superstition, nor yet of vanitie
in this behalfe. For if God suffered false prophets among the
children of Israeli, being Gods peculiar people, and hypocrits in the
church of Christ ; no marvell if there were such people amongst the
heathen, which neither professed nor knew him.

0 the objects wherenpon the aui^arors used to prognosticate, with
certeine cautions and notes.

FIE Gentiles, which treat of this matter, repeat an
innumerable multitude of objects, whereupon they prog-
nosticate good or bad lucke. And a great matter is
made of neezing, wherein the number of neezings & the
time therof is greatlie noted ; the tingling in the finger, the elbowe,

meeting of beasts ; with this generall caution, that the object or

regard, children and some old fooles have to the gathering primrose,
true loves, and foure leaved grasse ; Item the person unto whome
such an object offereth it selfe unawares ; Item- the intention of the
divinor, whereby the object which is met, is referred to augurie ; Item

sudden met withall ; and so foorth.

two or three daies before the battell is fought ; which was seene and
tried at the battell of Troie : and in respect thereof, the griph was
allowed to be the cheefe bird of augurie. But among the innumer-
able number of the portentous beasts, fowles, serpents, and other
creatures, the tode is the most excellent object, whose ouglie deformitie
signifieth sweete and amiable fortune : in respect whereof some super-
stitious witches preserve todes for their familiars. And some one of
good credit (whome I could name) having conventcd the witches
themselves, hath starved diverse of their divels, which they kept in
boxes in the likenesse of todes.

Pheiarch CJiironccits saith, that the place and site of the signes
that we receive by augurie, are speciallie to be noted : for if we
receive them on the left side, good lucke ; if on the right side, ill
lucke insueth : bicause terrene and mortall things are opposite & con-
trarie to divine and heavenlie things ; for that which the gods
deliver with the right hand, falleth to our left side ; and so contrari-
wise.

The division of aUi^Krie, persons adinittable into the colleges
of augtirie, of their superstition.

I HE latter divinors in these mysteries, have divided their
soothsaiengs into twelve superstitions : as Augustiniis
NipJins termeth them. The first is prosperitie ; the
second, ill lucke, as when one goeth out of his house, and
seeth an unluckie beast heng on the right side of his waie ; the third
is destinie ; the fourth is fortune ; the fift is ill hap, as when an in-
fortunate beast feedeth on the right side of your waie ; the sixt is
utilitie ; the seventh is hurt ; the eight is called a cautell, as when a
beast followeth one, and staieth at any side, not passing beyond him,
which is a signe of good lucke ; the ninth is infelicitie, and that is
contrarie to the eight, as when the beast passeth before one ; the
tenth is perfection ; the eleventh is imperfection ; the twelfe is con-
clusiin.* Thus farre he.

Among the Romans none could be received into the college of
augurors that had a bile, or had beene bitten with a dog, &c : and at
the times of their exercise, even at noone daies, they lighted candels.
From whence the papists conveie unto their church, those points of
infidelitie. Finallie, their observations were so infinite and ridiculous,
that there flew not a sparkle out of the fier, but it betokened some-
what.

Of the common peoples fond and stiperstitiotis colkctioiis and
observations.

MONGST us there be manic women, and effeminat men
(marie papists alwaies, as by their superstition may
appeere) that make great divinations upon the shedding
of salt, wine, &c : and for the observation of daies, and
houres use as great *withcraft as in anie thing. For if one chance to
take a fall from a horsse, either in a slipperie or stumbling waie, he will
note the dale and houre, and count that time unluckch* for a journie.
Otherwise, he that receiveth a mischance, wil consider whether he
met not a cat, or a hare, when he went first out of hfr* doores in the
morning ; or stumbled not at the threshhold at his going out ; or put
not on his shirt the wrong side outwards ; or his left shoo on his
right foote, which Attgiistiis Casar reputed for the woorst lucke that
mi.uht befall. But above all other nations (as Martintis de Aries
witnesseth) the Spaniards are most superstitious herein ; & of
Spaine, the people of the province of Lnsitania is the most fond.
For one will saie ; I had a dreame to night, or a crowe croked upon
my house, or an owle flew by me and screeched (which augurie
Lncius Silla tooke of his death) or a cocke crew contrarie to his
houre. Another saith ; The moone is at the prime ; another, that the
sun rose in a cloud and looked pale, or a starre shot and shined in
the aire, or a strange cat came into the house, or a hen fell from the
top of the house.

Many will go to bed againe, if they neeze before their shooes be on
their feet ; some will hold fast their left thombe in their right hand
when they hickot ; or else will hold their chinne with their right hand
whiles a gospell is soong. It is thought verie ill lucke of some, that
a child, or anie other living creature, should passe betweene two
friends as they walke togither; for they say it portendeth a division
of freendship. Among the papists themselves, if any hunters, as they
were a hunting, chanced to meet a frier or a preest ; they thought it
so ill lucke, as they would couple up their hounds, and go home,
being in despaire of any further sport that daie. Marrie if they had
used venerie with abegger, they should win all the monie they plaied
for that daie at dice. The like follie is to be imputed unto them, that
observe (as true or probable) old verses, wherein can be no reasonable
cause of such effects ; which are brought to passe onlie by Gods
power, and at his pleasure. Of this sort be these that follow :

Trisniegistits affirmeth, that all augurificall things are mooved by

the opinion of Plotimis and laiiibichus. Some other affirme they
are mooved by the moone wandering through the twelve signes of
the Zodiake : bicause the moone hath dominion in all sudden
matters. The Aegyptian astronomers hold, that the moone order-
eth not those portentous matters, but Stella errans, a wandering
starre, &c.

150. The xvii. Chapter.

Hotu ridiculous an art attgurie is, how Cato mocked it, Arista ties
reasoti against it, fond collections of augurors, who allowed, and
who disallowed it.

iERELIE all these observations being neither grounded

on Gods word, nor physicall or philosophical! reason, are

vanities, superstitions, lies, and meere witchcraft ; as

whereby the world hath long time beene, and is still

abused and cousened. It is written ; Non est vestrum scire tempora

6^ momenta, &r^c : It is not for you to knowe the times and seasons,

which the father hath put in his owne power. The most godlie men

and the wisest philosophers have given no credit hereunto. S.

Augustifie saith ; Qui his divinationibtis credit, sciat sefideni christi-

anavi &^ baptismum pravaricassc, &^ paganum Deiq; ini7nicJtm esse.

One told Cato, that a rat had carried awaie and eaten his hose, which

the partie said was a woonderfull signe. Naie (said Cato) I thinke not

so ; but if the hose had eaten the rat, that had beene a wonderfull

20". token indeed. When Nonius told Cicero that they should have good

successe in battell, bicause seven eagles were taken in Ponipeies

campe, he answered thus ; No doubt it will be even so, if that we

chance to fight with pies. In the like case also he answered Labienzis,

who prophesied like successe by such divinations, saieng, that

through the hope of such toies, Pompcic lost all his pavillions not long

before.

What wiseman would thinke, that God would commit his counsell
to a dawe, an owle, a swine, or a tode ; or that he would hide his
secret purposes in the doong and bowels of beasts ? Aristotle thus
reasoneth ; Augurie or divinations are neither the causes nor effects

of things to come ; Ergo, they doo not thereby foretell things trulie,
but by chance. As if I dreame that my freend will come to my
house, and he commeth indeed : yet neither dreame nor imagination
is more the cause of my freends comming, than the chattering of
a pie.

When Haiiibnl overthrew Marcus Marcellus, the beast sacrificed
wanted a peece of his hart ; therefore forsooth Afarius, when he
sacrificed at Utica, and the beast lacked his liver, he must needs have
the like successe. These are their collections, and as vaine, as if
they said that the building of Tenderden steeple was the cause of
Coodwine sands, or the decaie of Sa7idivicJi haven. 6". Augustine August, lib.
saith, that these observations are most superstitious. But we read in j.'^af.'L "'
the fourth psalme, a sentence which might dissuade anie christian Psai 4, '•
from this follie and impietie ; O ye sonnes of men, how long will you
turne my gloria into shame, loving vanitie, and seeking lies.'' The
like is read in manie other places of scripture.

Of such as allow this follie, I can commend Plinie best, who saith, FUn. lib. na-
that the operation of these auguries is as we take them. For if we 28. 'i:<z>. 2. '
take them in good part, they are signes of good lucke ; if we take '\ib\il\\'l.]]l
them in ill part, ill lucke followeth ; if we neglect them, and wey 151.
them not, they doo neither good nor harme. Thomas of AquiJie
reasoneth in this wise ; The starres, whose course is certeine, have
greater affinitie and communitie with mans actions, than auguries ;
and yet our dooings are neither directed nor proceed from the starres.
Which thing also Ptolome witnesseth, saieng ; Sapiens dominabitur
asU'is^ A Wiseman overruleth the starres.

The 18. Chapter. 208

Fond disti7ictiGns of the heatlieii writers, concerning augurie.

|HE heathen made a distinction betweene divine, naturall,
and casuall auguries. Divine auguries were such, as
men were made beleeve were done miraculouslie, as
when dogs spake ; as at the expulsion of Tarquinius out q Epidius.
of his kingdome ; or when trees spake, as before the death of Ccesar ; Homer. lU-
or when horsses spake, as did a horsse, whose name was Zaiithus.
Manie learned christians confesse, that such things as may indeed
have divine cause, may be called divine auguries ; or rather fore-
warnings of God, and tokens either of his blessings or discontentation :
as the starre was a token of a safe passage to the magicians that
sought Christ ; so was the cockcrowing an augurie to Peter for his
conversion. And manie such other divinations or auguries (if it be
lawfull so to tcrme them) are in the scriptures to be found.

ATURALL augurie is a physicall or philosophical! obser-
vation ; bicause humane and naturall reason may be
yeelded for such events : as if one heare the cocke crow
aj manie times together, a man may ghesse that raine will
follovve shortlie ; as by the crieng of rooks, and by their extraordi-
narie using of their wings in their flight, bicause through a naturall
instinct, provoked by the impression of the heavenlie bodies, they
are mooved to know the times, according to the disposition of the
weather, as it is necessarie for their natures. And therefore Jeremie
saith ; Milviis in ccelo cogtiovit tenipus sinon. The physician may
argue a strength towards in his patient, when he heareth him neeze
twise, which is a naturall cause to judge by, and conjecture upon.
But sure it is meere casuall, and also verie foolish and incredible, that
by two neezings, a man should be sure of good lucke or successe in
his businesse ; or by meeting of a tode, a man should escape a
danger, or atchieve an enterprise, &c.

The vani-
tie of casu-
all augurie.




A confutation of castiall aitgurie which is nieere witchcraft, and upon
what uncertaintie those diviiiations are grounded.

JHAT imagination worketh in man or woman, many
leaves would not comprehend ; for as the qualities
thereof are strange, and almost incredible, so would the
discourse thereof be long and tedious, wherof I had
occasion to speake elsewhere. But the power of our imagination
extendeth not to beasts, nor reacheth to birds, and therefore perteineth
not hereunto. Neither can the chance for the right or left side be
good or bad lucke in it selfe. Why should any occurrent or augurie
be good ? Bicause it commeth out of that part of the heavens, where
the good or beneficiall stars are placed 1 By that reason, all things
should be good and happie that live on that side ; but we see the
contrarie experience, and as commonlie as that.

The like absurditie and error is in them that credit those divina-
tions ; bicause the starres, over the ninth house have dominion at the
time of augurie. If it should betoken good lucke, joy or gladnesse, to
heare a noise in the house, when the moone is in Aries : and contrari-

wise, if it be a signe of ill lucke, sorrowe, or greefe for a beast to

come into the house, the moone being in the same signe : here might

be found a fowle error and contrarietie. And forsomuch as both 210.

may happen at once, the rule must needs be false and ridiculous.

And if there were any certeine rules or notes to be gathered in these

divinations ; the abuse therein is such, as the word of God must needs

be verefied therein ; to wit, I will destroie the tokens of soothsaiers, isai. 44, 25.

and make them that conjecture, fooles.




The xxi. Chapter,

That figure-casters are witches, the uncerteintie of their art, and of
their contradictions, Cornelius Agrippas sentence against judiciall
astrologie.

HESE casters of figures may bee numbred among the
cousening witches, whose practise is above their reach,
their purpose to gaine, their knowledge stolne from poets,
their art uncerteine & full of vanitie, more plainly derided
in the scriptures, than any other follie. And thereupon many other
trifling vanities are rooted and grounded ; as physiognomic, palmes-
trie, interpreting of dreames, monsters, auguries, &c ; the professors
whereof confesse this to be the necessarie key to open the knowledge of
all their secrets. For these fellowes erect a figure of the heavens, bj
the exposition whereof (togither with the conjectures of similitudes
and signes) they seeke to find out the meaning of the significators,
attributing to them the ends of all things, contrarie to truth, reason,
and divinitie : their rules being so inconstant, that few writers agree
in the verie principles therof. For the Rabbins, the old and new
writers, and the verie best philosophers dissent in the cheefe grounds
thereof, differing in the proprietie of the houses, whereout they wring
the foretelling of things to come, contending even about the number
of spheres, being not yet resolved how to erect the beginnings and
endes of the houses : for Ptolomie maketh them after one sort, Cani-
patius after another, &c.

And as Alpetragus thinketh, that there be in the heavens
diverse movings as yet to men unknowne, so doo others afiirme (not
without probabilitie) that there male be starres and bodies, to whome
these movings male accord, which cannot be seene, either through
their exceeding highnes, or that hitherto are not tried with anie obser-
vation of the art. The true motion of Mars is not yet perceived,
neither is it possible to find out the true entring of the sunne into
the equinoctiall points. It is not denied, that the astronomers them-

selves have received their light, and their verie art from poets, with-
out whose fables the twelve signes and the northerlie and southerlie
figiu'cs had never ascended into heaven. And yet (as C. Agrippa
saith) astrologers doo live, cousen men, and gaine by these fables ;
whiles the poets, which are the inventors of them, doo live in
beggerie.

The verie skilfullest mathematicians confesse, that it is unpossible
to find out anie certeine thing concerning the knowledge of judge-
ments, as well for the innumerable causes which worke togither with
the heavens, being all togither, and one with the other to be con-
sidered : as also bicause influencies doo not constraine but incline.
For manie ordinarie and extraordinarie occasions doo interrupt them ;
as education, custome, place, honestie, birth, bloud, sickness'^, health,
strength, weakenes, meate, drinke, libertie of mind, learning, &c. And
they that have written the rules of judgement, and agree neerest
therein, being of equall authoritie and learning, publish so contrarie
opinions upon one thing, that it is unpossible for an astrologian to
pronounce a certeintie upon so variable opinions ; & otherwise, upon
so uncerteine reports no man is able to judge herein. So as
(according to Ptolomie) the foreknowledge of things to come by the
starres, dependeth as well upon the affections of the mind, as upon
the observation of the planets, proceeding rather from chance than art,
as whereby they deceive others, and are deceived themselves also.

tions fall out right, then they triumph above measure. If the
prognosticators be found to forge and lie alwaies (without such
fortune as the blind man had in killing the crow) they will excuse the
matter, saieng, that Sapiens domiitatur astris, wheras (according to
Ai^rippas words) neither the wiseman ruleth the starres, nor the
starres the wiseman, but God ruleth them both. Corn. Tacitus saith,
that they are a people disloiall to princes, deceiving them that
beleeve them. And Varro saith, that the vanitie of all superstitions
floweth out of the bosome of astrologie. And if our life & fortune
depend not on the starres, then it is to be granted, that the astrologers
seeke where nothing is to be found. But we are so fond, mistrustful!
& credulous, that we feare more the fables of Robin good fellow ; as-
trologers, & witches, &; beleeve more the things that are not, than the
things that are. And the more unpossible a thing is, the more we stand
in feare thereof; and the lesse likelie to be true, the more we beleeve it.
And if we were not such, I thinke with Cornelius Agrippa, that these
divinors, astrologers, conjurors, and cousenors would die for hunger.

And our foolish light beleefe, forgetting things past, neglecting
things present, and verie hastie to know things to come, doth so
comfort and mainteine these cousenors ; that whereas in other men,
for making one lie, the faith of him that speaketh is so much mis-
trusted, that all the residue being true is not regarded. Contrariwise,
in these cousenages among our divinors, one truth spoken by hap
giveth such credit to all their lies, that ever after we beleeve whatso-
ever they saie ; how incredible, impossible or false soever it be. Sir
Thotnas Moore saith, they know not who are in their owne chambers,
neither who maketh themselves cuckoldes that take upon them all this judidail

or rather to manifest their impudencie, they saie the gift of prophesie,
the force of religion, the secrets of conscience, the power of divels,
the vertue of miracles, the efficacie of praiers, the state of the life to
come, &c : doth onlie depend upon the starres, and is given and knowne
by them alone. For they saie, that when the signe of Gemini is
ascended, and Saturne and Mercuric be ioined in Aquarie, in the Astroiogi-

that Christ had so manie vertues, bicause he had in that place Saturne
and Gemini. Yea these Astrologers doo not sticke to saie, that the
starres distribute all sortes of religions: wherein y«z7(?r is the especiall
patrone, who being joined with Saturne, maketh the religion of the
Jcwes; with Mercz{rie, of the Christians; with the Moone, of Anti-
christianitie. Yea they affirme that the faith of everie man male be
knowne to them as well as to God. And that Christ himselfe did use
the election of houres in his miracles; so as the Jewes could not hurt

he findeth the Moone and y?^r joined with the dragons head in the

fupiter and Saturne doo give blessednes of the life to come. But if
anie in his nativitie shall have Sattirne happilie placed in Leone, his
soule shall have everlasting life. And hereunto subscribe Peter de
Appona, Roger Bacon, Guido Bonatus, Arnold de villa nova, and the
Cardinall of Alia. Furthermore, the providence of God is denied,
and the miracles of Christ are diminished, when these powers of the
heavens and their influencies are in such sort advanced. Moses,
Esaie, fob and feremie, seeme to dislike and reject it: and at Rome
in times past it was banished, and by fnstinian condemmed under
paine of death. Finallie, Seneca derideth these soothsaieng witches
in this sort; Amongst the Cleones (saith he) there was a custome, that
the -^fiXa^ocyvXaKei (which were gazers in the aier, watching when a
storme of haile should fall) when they sawe by anie cloud that the
shower was imminent and at hand; the use was (I saie) bicause of the
hurt which it might doo to their vines, &.c: diligentlie to warne the
people thereof; who used not to provide clokes or anie such
defense against it, but provided sacrifices; the rich, cockes and
white lambes ; the poore would spoile themselves by cutting their
thombes ; as though (saith he) that little bloud could ascend up
to the cloudes, and doo anie good there for their releefe in this
matter.

And here by the waie, I will impart unto you a Venetian supersti-
tion, of great antiquitie, and at this daie (for ought I can read to the
contrarie) in use. It is written, that everie yeere ordinarilie upon
ascension daie, the Duke of Venice, accompanied with the States,
goeth with great solemnitie unto the sea, and after ctrteine ceremonies
ended, casteth thereinto a gold ring of great value and estimation for

that the wrath of the sea was asswaged. By this action, as a late
writer saith, they doo Desponsare sibi inare, that is, espouse the sea Joannes Gar-

Let us therefore, according to the prophets advise, aske raine f^'^^;^
of the Lord in the houres of the latter time, and he shall verse 2

send white cloudes, and give us raine &c : for surelie,
the idols (as the same prophet saith) have spoken
vanitie, the soothsaiers have seene a lie, and
the dreamers have told a vaine thing.
They comfort in vaine, and therefore
they went awaie like sheepe, &c.

HIS Hebrue word Habar, being in Greeke Epathii, and
in Latine Incantat'e, is in English, To inchant, or (if you
had rather have it so) to bewitch. In these inchant-
ments, certeine wordes, verses, or charmes, &c : are
secretlie uttered, wherein there is thought to be miraculous efficacie.
There is great varietie hereof : but whether it be by charmes, voices,
images, characters, stones, plants, metals, herbes, &c : there must
herewithall a speciall forme of words be alwaies used, either divine,
diabolicall, insensible, or papisticall, whereupon all the vertue of the
worke is supposed to depend. This word is speciallie used in the 58.
psalme, which place though it be taken up for mine adversaries
strongest argument against me ; yet me thmkes it maketh so with
me, as they can never be able to answer it. For there it plainelie
appeareth, that the adder heareth not the voice of the charmer,
charme he never so cunninglie : contrarie to the poets fabling,

Frigidus in pratis cantando riimpitur anguis.\

The coldish snake in tnedowes greeiie.
With charmes is burst in peeces cleene.

But hereof more shall be said hereafter in due place.

I grant that words sometimes have singular vertue and efficacie,
either in persuasion or disuasion, as also diverse other waies ; so as
thereby some are converted from the waie of perdition, to the
estate of salvation : and so contrariwise, according to the
saieng of Solomon ; Death and life are in the instru-
ment of the toong : but even therein God worketh
all in all, as well in framing the heart of
the one, as in directing the toong of
the other : as appeareth in
manie places of the holie
scriptures.

The second Chapter.

What is forbidden in scriptiires concerning witchcraft, of the opera-
tion of words, the superstition of the Cabalists and papists, who
createth substances, to imitate God in some cases is presumption,
words of sanctification.

HAT which is forbidden in the scriptures touching in-
ch antment or witch craft, is not the wonderfull working
with words. For where words have had miraculous
operation, there hath beene alwaies the special! provi-
dence, power and grace of God uttered to the strengthening of the
faith of Gods people, and to the furtherance of the gospell : as when
the apostle with a word slue Ananias and Saphira. But the propha-
nation of Gods name, the seducing, abusing, and cousening of the
people, and mans presumption is hereby prohibited, as whereby manie
take upon them after the recitall of such names, as God in the
scripture seemeth to appropriate to himselfe, to foreshew things to
come, to worke miracles, to detect fellonies, &c : as the Cabalists in
times past tooke upon them, by the ten names of God, and his angels,
expressed  in the scriptures, to worke woonders : and as the papists
at this daie by the like names, by crosses, by gospels hanged about
their necks, by masses, by exorcismes, by holie water, and a thousand
consecrated or rather execrated things, promise unto themselves and
others, both health of bodie and soule.

But as herein we are not to imitate the papists, so in such things,
as are the peculiar actions of God, we ought not to take upon us to
counterfet, or resemble him, which with his word created all things.
For we, neither all the conjurors, Cabalists, papists, soothsaiers,
inchanters, witches, nor charmers in the world, neither anie other
humane or yet diabolicall cunning can adde anie such strength to
Gods workmanship, as to make anie thing anew, or else to exchange
one thing into another. New qualities may be added by humane art,
but no new substance can be made or created by man. And seeing
that art faileth herein, doubtles neither the illusions of divels, nor
the cunning cA witches, can bring anie such thing truelie to passe.
For by the sound of the words nothing commeth, nothing goeth, other-
wise than God in nature hath ordeined to be doone by ordinarie
speech, or else by his speciall ordinance. Indeed words of sanctifica-
tion are necessarie and commendable, according to S. Paules rule ;
Let your meat be sanctified with the word of God, and by praier. But
sanctification dooth not here signifie either change of substance of the

HE words and other the illusions of witches, charmers,
and conjurors, though they be not such in opera-
tion and efifect, as they are commonlie taken to be :

21 g | R<MSg5SSig | yet they are offensive to the majestie and name of
God, obscuring the truth of divinitie, & also of philosophie. For
if God onlie give life & being to all creatures, who can put any

158. such vertue or livelie feeling into a body of gold, silver, bread, or
wax, as is imagined ? If either preests, divels, or witches could so
doo, the divine power shuld be checked & outfaced by magicall
cunning, & Gods creatures made servile to a witches pleasure. What
is not to be brought to passe by these incantations, if that be true
which is attributed to witches? & yet they are women that never went
to schoole in their lives, nor had any teachers : and therefore without
art or learning ; poore, and therefore not able to make any provision
of metal or stones, &c : whereby to bring to passe strange matters, by
naturall magicke ; old and stiffe, and therefore not nimble handed to
deceive your eie with legierdemaine; heavie, and commonlie lame,
and therefore unapt to flie in the aire, or to danse with the fairies ;
sad, melancholike, sullen, and miserable, and therefore it should be
unto them {Iiivita Minerva) to banket or danse with Minerva ; or
yet with Herodias, as the common opinion of all writers heerein is.
On the other side, we see they are so malicious and spitefull, that if they
by themselves, or by their divels, could trouble the elements, we should
never have faire weather. If they could kill men, children, or cattell,
they would spare none ; but would destroy and kill whole countries
and housholds. If they could transfer corne (as is affirmed) from
their neighbors field into their owne, none of them would be poore,
none other should be rich. If they could transforme themselves and
others (as it is most constantlie affirmed) oh what a number of apes
and owles should there be of us ! If Incubus could beget Merlins
among us, we should have a joUie manie of cold prophets.

The fourth Chapter. 220.

Why God forbad the practise of witchcraft, the absttrditie of the
lawe of the twelve tables, wherejtpon their estimation in miracu-
lous actions is grounded, of their woonderotts works.

HOUGH it be apparent, tjiat the Holie-ghost forbiddeth a common
this art, bicause of the abuse of the name of God, and the ^^^ "f^'

' _ ' versall er-

cousenage comprehended therein : yet I confesse, the cus- ror.

tomes and lawes ahnost of all nations doo declare, that all
these miraculous works, before by me cited, and many other things
more woonderfull, were attributed to the power of witches. The which
lawes, with the executions and judicials thereupon, and the witches
confessions, have beguiled almost the whole world. What absurdities
concerning witchcraft, are written in the law of the twelve tables,
which was the highest and most ancient law of the Romans } Where-
upon the strongest argument of witches omnipotent power is
framed ; as that the wisedome of such lawgivers could not be abused.
Whereof (me thinks) might be made a more strong argument on our
side; to wit. If the cheefe and principall lawes of the world be in this
case ridiculous, vaine, false, incredible, yea and contrarie to Gods
lawe ; the residue of the lawes and arguments to that effect, are to
be suspected. If that argument should hold, it might proove all
the popish lawes against protestants, & the heathenish princes lawes 159.
against christians, to be good and in force : for it is like they would
not have made them, except they had beene good. Were it not

The fift Chapter.

An instance of one arreigned upon the laive of tJte iivch'e tables,
whereby the said la%ve is proved ridiculous., of two witches that
could doo woonders.

LTHOUGH among us, we thinke them bewitched that
waxsuddenlie poore, and not them that growe hastilie rich ;
yet at Rofne yon shall understand, that (as ^wVreporteth)
upon these articles one C. Fut'ius Cressus was convented
before Spurius Albinus ; for that he being but a little while free, and
delivered from bondage, occupieng onelie tillage ; grew rich on the
sudden, as having good crops : so as it was suspected that he transferred
his neighbors corne into his fields. None intercession, no delaie,
none excuse, no deniall would serve, neither in jest nor derision, nor
yet through sober or honest meanes : but he was assigned a peremp-
torie dale, to answer for life. And therefore fearing the sentence of
condemnation, which was to be given there, by the voice and verdict
of three men (as we heere are tried by twelve) made his appearance
at the dale assigned, and brought with him his ploughs and harrowes,
spades and shovels, and other instruments of husbandrie, his oxen,
horsses, and working bullocks, his servants, and also his daughter,
which was a sturdie wench and a good huswife, and also (as Piso
reporteth) well trimmed up in apparell, and said to the whole bench
in this wise ; Lo heere my lords I make mine appearance, according
to my promise and your pleasures, presenting unto you my charmes
and witchcrafts, which have so inriched me. As for the labour, sweat,
watching, care, and diligence, which I have used in this behalfe, I
cannot shew you them at this time. And by this meanes he was dis-
missed by the consent of that court, who otherwise (as it was thought)
should hardly have escaped the sentence of condemnation, and
punishment of death.

It is constantlie aftirmed in M. Mai. that Stafus used alwaies to
hide himselfe in a *monshoall, and had a disciple called Hoppo., who
made Stadlin a maister witch, and could all when they list invisiblie
transferre the third part of their neighbours doong, hay, corne, &c : into
theire owne ground, make haile, tempests, and flouds, with thunder
and lightning; and kill children, cattell, &c : reveale things hidden,
and many other tricks, when and where they list. But these two
shifted not so well with the inquisitors, as the other with the Romanc
and heathen judges. Howbcit, Stafus was too hard for them all :

for none of all the lawiers nor inquisitors could bring him to
appeere before them, if it be true that witchmongers write in these
matters.



The sixt Chapter.

Lawes provided for the pii7iishment of such witches as worke
tniracles, whereof some are mentioned^ and of certeinc popish
lawes published a^s^ainst them.




HERE are other lawes of other nations made to this in-
credible effect : as Lex Salicartun provideth punishment
for them that flie in the aire from place to place, and
meete at their nightlie assemblies, and brave bankets, car-
rieng with them plate, and such stuffe, &c : even as we should make
a lawe to hang him that should take a church in his hand at Dover,
and throvve it to Callice. And bicause in this case also popish lawes
shall be scene to be as foolish and lewd as any other whatsoever, and
speciallie as tyrannous as that which is most cruell : you shall heare
what trim new lawes the church oi Rome hath latelie devised. These
are therefore the words of pope Innocent the eight to the inquisitors
oi Almanie, and oi pope uli2is the second, sent to the inquisitors of
Bergomen. It is come to our eares, that manie lewd persons, of both
kinds, as well male as female, using the companie of the divels
Incubus and Succubus, with incantations, charmes, conjurations, &c :
doo destroie, &.c : the births of women with child, the yoong of all
cattell, the corne of the feeld, the grapes of the vines, the frute of the
trees : Item, men, women, and all kind of cattell and beasts of the
feeld : and with their said inchantments, &c : doo utterlie extinguish,
suffocate, and spoile all vineyards, ortchards, medowes, pastures,
grasse, greene corne, and ripe corne, and all other podware : yea men
and women themselves are by their imprecations so afflicted with
externall and inward paines and diseases, that men cannot beeget,
nor women bring foorth anie children, nor yet accomplish the dutie of
wedlocke, denieng the faith which they in baptisme professed, to the
destruction of their owne soules, &c. Our pleasure therefore is,
that all impediments that male hinder the inquisitors office, be utterlie
removed from among the people, least this blot of heresie proceed to
poison and defile them that be yet innocent. And therefore we doo
ordeine, by vertue of the apostolicall authoritie, that our inquisitors
of high Almanie, maie execute the office of inquisition by all tortures
and afflictions, in all places, and upon all persons, what and where-

Neverthelesse, popish writers (I confesse) have advantage herein of

advantage) the word and authoritie of the pope himselfe, and others
of that holie crue ; whose charmes, conjurations, blessings, curssings,
&c : I meane in part (for a tast) to set downe ; giving you to under-

neither seeme they so ignorant, prophane, or impious. And there-

Popish periapts, amulets and charmes, agnus Dei, a wastcote of

HESE vertues under these verses (written by pope Urbane
the fift to the emperour of the Grcecians) are conteined in
a periapt or tablet, to be continuallie worne about one,
called Agnus Dei, which is a little cake, having the
picture of a lambe carrieng of a flag on the one side ; and Christs
head on the other side, and is hollow : so as the gospell of S. John,
written in fine paper, is placed in the concavitie thereof : and it is
thus compounded or made, even as they themselves report.

^1 A charme against shot, or a wastcote of proofe.

BEfoie the comming up of these Agtms Deis, a holie garment
called a wastcote for necessitie was much used of our forefathers,
as a holy relike, &c : as given by the pope, or some such archcon-
juror, who promised thereby all manner of immunitie to the wearer
thereof ; in somuch as he could not be hurt with anie shot or other
violence. And otherwise, that woman that would weare it, should
have quicke deliverance : the composition thereof was in this order
following.

On Christmas daie at night, a threed must be sponne of flax, by a
little virgine girle, in the name of the divell : and it must be by hir
woven, and also wrought with the needle. In the brest or forepart
thereof must be made with needle worke two heads ; on the head at
the right side must be a hat, and a long beard ; the left head must
have on a crowne, and it must be so horrible, that it maie resemble
Belzebub, and on each side of the wastcote must be made a crosse.

charme, of the iveari7tg afid bearing of the name of fesus, that
the sacrament of confession and the eucharist is of as much
efficacie as other charmes, &-" magnified by L. Vairus.

|F I did well, I should shew you the confection of all their
stuffe, and how they prepare it; but it would be too long.
And therefore you shall onlie have in this place a few
notes for the composition of certeine receipts, which in
stead of an Apothecarie if you deliver to any morrowmasse preest,
he will make them as well as the pope himselfe. Marie now they
wax everie parlement deerer and deerer ; although therewithal!, they
utter many stale drugs of their owne.

If you looke in the popish pontificall, you shall see how in eccUsia;
they make their holie water ; to wit, in this sort : I conjure
thee thou creature of water, in the name of the father, and of
the Sonne, & of the Holie-ghost, that thou drive the divell out of
everie corner and hole of this church, and altar ; so as he remaine
not within our precincts that are just and righteous. And water thus
used (as Durandiis saith) hath power of his owne nature to drive in rationali
away divels. If you will learne to make any more of this popish 'lffi]^i°rum.
stuffe, you may go to the verie masse booke, and find manie good
receipts : marrie if you search Du?-andus, &c ; you shall find
abundance.

I know that all these charmes, and all these palterie confections
(though they were farre more impious and foolish) will be mainteined 172.
and defended by massemongers, even as the residue will be by witch-
mongers : and therefore I will in this place insert a charme, the
authoritie wherof is equall with the rest, desiring to have their Pom.ser-
opinions herein. I find in a booke called Pomcct^ium sermonum quad- '«""• '^-■
ragesimalium, that S. F}-ancis seeing Rufnusj provoked of the divell 2j8.
to thinke himselfe damned, charged Rufinus to saie this charme, when

Leonard Vairus writcth., De veris, pits, ac Sanctis amuletis fascinum
atqj omnia venejicia destrnentibiis ; wherein he speciallie com-
mendeth the name of Jesus to be worne. But the sacrament of con-
fession he extoUeth above all things, saieng, that whereas Christ with
his power did but throwe divels out of mens bodies, the preest
driveth the divell out of mans soule by confession. For (saith he)
these words of the preest, when he saith, Ego te absolvo, are as
effectuall to drive awaie the princes of darknes, through the mightie
power of that saieng, as was the voice of God to drive awaie the
darknes of the world, when at the beginning he said, Fiat lux. He
commendeth also, as holesome things to drive awaie divels, the sacra-
ment of the eucharist, and solitarines, and silence. Finallie he saith,
that if there be added hereunto an Agnus Dei, and the same be worne
about ones necke by one void of sinne, nothing is wanting that is
good and holesome for this purpose. But he concludeth, that you
must weare and make dints in your forhead, with crossing your selfe
when you put on your shooes, and at everie other action, &c : and
that is also a present remedie to drive awaie divels, for they cannot
abide it.




The eleventh Chapter.

Of the noble balnie used by Moses., apishlie counterfeited ifi the
church of Rome.

I HE noble balnie that i^^J^i' made, having indeed manie
excellent vertues, besides the pleasant and comfortable
savour thereof ; wherewithall Moses in his pohtike lawes
enjoined kings, queenes, and princes to be annointed in
their true and lawfull elections and coronations, untill the everlasting
2jg. king had put on man upon him, is apishlie counterfeited in the
Romish church, with diverse terrible conjurations, three breathings,
crossewise, (able to make a quezie stomach spue) nine mumblings,
and three curtsies, saieng thereunto, Ave sa7tctum oleum, ter ave
saiictum balsamum. And so the divell is thrust out, and the Holie-
ghost let into his place. But as for Moses his balme, it is not now to
be found either in Rome or elsewhere that I can learne. And accord-
ing to this papisticall order, witches, and other superstitious people
follow on, with charmes and conjurations made in forme ; which
manie bad physicians also practise, when their learning faileth, as
maie appeare by example in the sequele.

doo good ; but harme he is sure they can doo none : urging that it is
necessarie and expedient for a physician to leave nothing undone that
may be devised for his patients recoverie ; and that by such meanes
manie great cures are done. He citeth a great number of experiments
out of Alexander Tralliaiites, Aetiiis, Octatnaims, Marcellus, PJiilo-
dotus, Archigines, Philostratus, Flhiie, and Dioscorides ; and would
make men beleeve that Galen (who in truth despised and derided all
those vanities) recanted in his latter daies his former opinion, and all
his invectives tending against these magicall cures : writing also a
booke intituled De Homerica medicatione, which no man could ever
see, but one Alexander Trallianus, who saith he saw it : and further 240
affirmeth, that it is an honest mans part to cure the sicke, by hooke
or by crooke, or by anie meanes whatsoever. Yea he saith that Galen
(who indeed wrote and taught that Incantamenta sunt inuliercularuni
figinenta, and be the onlie clokes of bad physicians) affirmeth, that
there is vertue and great force in incantations. As for example (saith
Trallian) Galen being now reconciled to this opinion, holdeth and
writeth, that the bones which sticke in ones throte, are avoided and
cast out with the violence of charmes and inchanting words ; yea and
that thereby the stone, the choUicke, the falling sicknes, and all fevers,
gowts, fluxes, fistulas, issues of bloud, and finallie whatsoever cure
(even beyond the skill of himselfe or anie other foolish physician) is
cured and perfectlie healed by words of inchantment. Marie M.
Ferrarius (although he allowed and practised this kind of physicke)
yet he protesteth that he thinketh it none otherwise effectuall, than
by the waie of constant opinion : so as he affirmeth that neither the
character, nor the charme, nor the witch, nor the devill accomplish
the cure ; as (saith he) the experiment of the toothach will manifestlie
declare, wherein the cure is wrought by the confidence or diffidence

This (saith he) commeth to the unlearned, through the opinion
which they conceive of the characters and holie words : but the
learned that know the force of the mind and imagination, worke
miracles by meanes thereof; so as the unlearned must have externall
helps, to doo that which the learned can doo with a word onelie. He
saith that this is called Homerica viedicatio, bicause Hotiter dis-

taken from a crosse, holie water, and the verie signe of the crosse,
with such like popish stuffe : I thinke he laboureth thereby rather to

physicke or philosophie. And I thinke thus the rather, for that he

But of these Homericall medicines he saith there are foure sorts,
whereof amulets, characters, & charmes are three : howbeit he com-
mendeth and preferreth the fourth above the rest ; and that he saith
consisteth in illusions, which he more properlie calleth stratagems.
Of which sort of conclusions he alledgeth for example, how PJiilodotus
did put a cap of lead upon ones head, who imagined he was headlesse,
whereby the partie was delivered from his disease or conceipt. Item
another cured a woman that imagined, that a serpent or snake did
continuallie gnaw and teare hir entrailes ; and that was done onelie
by giving hir a vomit, and by foisting into the matter vomited a little
serpent or snake, like unto that which she imagined was in hir bellie.

Item, another imagined that he alwaies burned in the fier, under
whose bed a fier was privilie conveied, which being raked out before
his face, his fancie was satisfied, and his heate allaied. Hereunto
perteineth, that the hickot is cured with sudden feare or strange
newes : yea by that meanes agues and manie other strange and
extreame diseases have beene healed. And some that have lien so
sicke and sore of the gowt, that they could not remove a joint,
through sudden feare of fier, or ruine of houses, have forgotten their
infirmities and greefes, and have runne awaie. But in my tract
upon melancholic, and the effects of imagination, and in the discourse

% Another charme or witch-craft for the sajne,

THis office or conjuration following was first authorised and
printed at Rome, and afterwards at Avenzon, Anno. 1515. And
least that the divell should lie hid in some secret part of the bodie,
everie part thereof is named ; Obsccro te festi Chrisfe, &^c: that is :
I beseech thee O Lord Jesus Christ, that thou pull out of everie
member of this man all infirmities, from his head, from his haire,
from his braine, from his forhead, from his eies, from his nose, from
his eares, from his mouth, from his toong, from his teeth, from his
jawes, from his throte, from his necke, from his backe, from his brest,
from his paps, from his heart, from his stomach, from his sides, from
his flesh, from his bloud, from his bones, from his legs, from his feete,
from his fingers, from the soles of his feete, from his marrowe, from
his sinewes, from his skin, and from everie joint of his members, &c.

Doubtles Jesus Christ could have no starting hole, but was hereby
everie waie prevented and pursued ; so as he was forced to doo the
cure : for it appeareth hereby, that it had beene insufficient for him
to have said ; Depart out of this man thou uncleane spirit, and that
when he so said he did not performe it. I doo not thinke that there
will be found among all the heathens superstitious fables, or among
the witches, conjurors, couseners, poets, knaves, fooles, &c : that ever
wrote, so impudent and impious a lie or charme as is read in Barnar-
di7ie de bustis ; where, to cure a sicke man, Christs bodie, to wit: a
wafer cake, was outwardlie applied to his side, and entred into his
heart, in the sight of all the standers by. Now, if grave authors
report such lies, what credit in these cases shall we attribute unto the

^ A cha7-})ie for the bots in a horsse.

YOu must both saie and doo thus upon the diseased horsse three
dales together, before the sunne rising: In no))iine pa^tris &^

&^ fi*^liuiii &^ spiritiiDi^sanctuni: that is, In the name of God the
Father, the Sonne, & the Holy-ghost, I conjure thee O worme by God
the Father, the Sonne, & the Holy-ghost ; that thou neither eat nor
drinke the flesh bloud or bones of this horsse ; and that thou
hereby maist be made as patient as fob, and as good as S. fohii\
Baptist, when he baptised Christ in fo7-dan. In nomine pa^iris &=

three Aves, in the right eare of the horsse, to the glorie of the holie
trinitie. Do^})iiiuis fili\iis spiri-^tiis AIari>^a.

There are also divers bookes imprinted, as it should appeare
with the authoritie of the church of Rome, wherein are conteined
manie medicinall praiers, not onelie against all diseases ofhorsses,
but also for everie impediment and fault in a horsse : in so much as
if a shoo fall off in the middest of his journie, there is a praier to
warrant your horsses hoofe, so as it shall not breake, how far so ever
he be from the Smithes forge.

Item, the Duke of Alba his horsse was consecrated, or canonized,
in the lowe countries, at the solemne masse ; wherein the popes bull,
and also his charme was published (which I will hereafter recite) he
in the meane time sitting as Vice-roy with his consecrated standard

[ONCERNING the charming of serpents and snakes,

mine adversaries (as I have said) thinke they have great

advantage by the words of David in the fiftie eight

psalme ; and by Jeretnie, chapter eight, expounding

the one prophet by Virgil, the other by Ovid. For the words of

Psai. 58. David are these ; Their poison is Hke the poison of a serpent, and

2^0. hke a deafe adder, that stoppeth his eare, and heareth not the voice

of the charmer, charme he never so cunningHe. The words of Virgil

are these, Frigidus in pratis cantando rumpitur anguis. As he might

saie, David thou hest ; for the cold natured snake is by the charmes

of the inchanters broken all to peeces in the field where he lieth.

Then commeth Ovid, and he taketh his countriemans part, saieng in

the name and person of a witch ; Vipereas rumpo verbis &^ carmine

fauces ; that is, I with my words and charmes can breake in sunder

the vipers jawes. Marrie feremie on the other side encountereth

this poeticall witch, and he not onelie defendeth, but expoundeth his

fellowe prophets words, and that not in his owne name, but in the

name of almightie God ; saieng, I will send serpents and cockatrices

among you, which cannot be charmed.

Now let anie indifferent man (christian or heathen) judge, whether
the words and minds of the prophets doo not directlie oppugne these
poets words (I will not saie minds :) for that I am sure they did therein
but jest and trifle, according to the common fabling of lieng poets.
And certeinlie, I can encounter them two with other two poets ;
namelie Propertius and Horace, the one merrilie deriding, the other
seriouslie impugning their fantasticall poetries, concerning the power
and omnipotencie of witches. For where Virgil, Ovid, &^c : write

But here it will be objected, that bicause it is said (in the places by Anobjecti-

A connie cannot flie: you should gather & conclude thereupon, that
I ment that all other beasts could flie. But you shall understand, that
the cause why these vipers can rather withstand the voice & practise
of inchanters and sorcerers, than other creatures, is: for that they
being in bodie and nature venomous, cannot so soone or properlie
receive their destruction by venome, wherby the witches in other
creatures bring their mischeefous practises more easilie to passe,

At Memphis in ^^;cr|'', among other juggling knacks, which were A stone
there usuallie shewed, there was one that tooke such paines with an thegreaf
asse, that he had taught him all these qualities following. And for t'o^iiiue of

' '^ ^ ° an asse.

gaine he caused a stage to be made, and an assemblie of people to
meete ; which being done, in the maner of a plaie, he came in with
his asse, and said ; The Sidtatie hath great need of asses to helpe to
carrie stones and other stuffe, towards his great building which he
hath in hand. The asse immediallie fell downe to the ground, and
by all signes shewed himselfe to be sicke, and at length to give up
the ghost : so as the juggler begged of the assemblie monie towards
his losse. And having gotten all that he could, he said ; Now my
maisters, you shall see mine asse is yet alive, and dooth but counter-
fet ; bicause he would have some monie to buie him provender,
knowing that I was poore, and in some need of releefe. Hereupon he
would needs laie a wager, that his asse was alive, who to everie mans
seeming was starke dead. And when one had laid monie with him
thereabout, he commanded the asse to rise, but he laie still as though
he were dead : then did he beate him with a cudgell, but that would
not serve the turne, untill he addressed this speech to the asse, saieng
(as before) in open audience ; The Sultane hath commanded, that
all the people shall ride out to morrow, and see the triumph, and
that the faire ladies will then ride upon the fairest asses, and will give
notable provender unto them, and everie asse shall drinke of the
sweete water of lYilus : and then lo the asse did presentlie start up,
and advance himselfe exceedinglie. Lo (quoth his maister) now I
have wonne : but in troth the Maior hath borrowed mine asse, for
the use of the old ilfavoured witch his wife : and thereupon immediat-
lie he hoong downe his eares, and halted downe right, as though he
had beene starke lame. Then said his maister ; I perceive you love
yoong prettie wenches : at which words he looked up, as it were with
joifull cheere. And then his maister did bid him go choose one that
should ride upon him ; and he ran to a verie handsome woman, and
touched hir with his head : &c. A snake will never be brought to
such familiaritie, &c. Bodin saith, that this was a man in the like-

the likenesse of a man. Well, to returne to our serpents, I will tell
you a storie concerning the charming of them, and the event of
the same.

In the citie of Salisborogli there was an inchanter, that before all
the people tooke upon him to conjure all the serpents and snakes
within one mile compasse into a great pit or dike, and there to kill John. Bodin
them. When all the serpents were gathered togither, as he stood
upon the brinke of the pit, there came at the last a great and a

horrible serpent, which would not be gotten downe with all the force
of his incantations : so as (all the rest being dead) he flew upon the
inchanter, and clasped him in the middest, and drew him downe into
the said dike, and there killed him. You must thinke that this was
a divell in a serpents likenesse, which for the love he bare to the
poore snakes, killed the sorcerer ; to teach all other witches to be-
ware of the like wicked practise. And surelie, if this be not true,
there be a great number of lies conteined in M. Mai. and iny. Bodin.
And if this be well weighed, and conceived, it beateth downe to the
ground all those witchmongers arguments, that contend to wring
witching miracles out of this place. For they disagree notablie, some
denieng and some affirming that serpents male be bewitched.
Neverthelesse, bicause in everie point you shall see how poperie
agreeth with paganisme, I will recite certeine charmes against vipers,
allowed for the most part in and by the church of Rojue : as
followeth.

I conjure thee O serpent in this houre, by the five holie woonds
of our Lord, that thou remove not out of this place, but here stale,
as certeineUe as God was borne of a pure virgine. -$- Otherwise :
I conjure thee serpent Iti nojtine patris, &^ Jilii, dr' spiritus sancti :
I command thee serpent by our ladie S. Marie., that thou obeie
me, as wax obeieth the fier, and as fier obeieth water ; that thou
neither hurt me, nor anie other christian, as certeinelie as God
was borne of an immaculate virgine, in which respect I take thee
up. In nomine patris &^ filii, &^ spiritus sancti : Ely lash eiter, ely
lash eiter, ely lash eiter. ■0- Otherwise : O vermine, thou must come
as God came unto the Jewes. 4^ Otherwise : L. Vairus saith,
that Serpens quernis frondibus contacta, that a serpent touched with
oke leaves dieth, and staieth even in the beginning of his going, if
a feather of the bird Jbis be cast or throwne upon him : and that
a viper smitten or hot with a reed is astonied, and touched with a
beechen branch is presentlie numme and stiffe.

Here is to be remembred, that manie use to boast that they are of
S. Patties race and kinred, shewing upon their bodies the prints of
serpents : which (as the papists affirme) was incident to all them of
S. Paules stocke, Marie they saie herewithall, that all his kinsfolks
can handle serpents, or anie poison without danger. Others likewise
have (as they brag) a Katharine wheele upon their bodies, and they
saie they are kin to S. Katharine, and that they can carrie burning
coles in their bare hands, and dip their said hands in hot skalding
liquor, and also go into hot ovens. Whereof though the last be but a
bare jest, and to be doone by anie that will prove (as a bad fellow in
London had used to doo, making no tariance at all therein :) yet there

is a shew made of the other, as though it were certeine and undoubted ;
by annointing the hands with the juice of mallowes, mercuiie, urine,
&c: which for a Httle time are defensatives against these scalding
liquors, and scortching fiers.

But they that take upon them to worke these mysteries and
miracles, doo indeed (after rehearsall of these and such like words
and charmes) take up even in their bare hands, those snakes and
vipers, and sometimes put them about their necks, without receiving
anie hurt thereby, to the terror and astonishment of the beholders,
which naturallie both feare and abhorre all serpents. But these char-
mers (upon my word) dare not trust to their charmes, but use such
an inchantment, as everie man male lawfullie use, and in the lawful!
use thereof maie bring to passe that they shalbe in securitie, and take
no harme, how much soever they handle them : marie with a woollen
rag they pull out their teeth before hand, as some men saie ; but as
truth is, they wearie them, and that is of certeintie. And surelie this is
a kind of witchcraft, which 1 terme private confederacie. Bodin J-Bodin.iib.

made of wax, to be rid of a witch, to hang hir up, notable
authorities against liMxxen images, a storie bewraieng the knaverie
of waxen images.

EONARDUS VAIRUS saith, that there was a praier
extant, whereby might be carried in a sive, water, or
other liquor : I thinke it was Clam claie ; which a crow
taught a maid, that was promised a cake of so great
quantitie, as might be kneded of so much floure as she could wet
with the water that she brought in a sive, and by that meanes she
clamd it with claie, & brought in so much water, as whereby she
had a great cake, and so beguiled hir sisters, &c. And this tale
I heard among my grandams maides, whereby I can decipher this
witchcraft. Item, by the tingling of the eare, men heretofore could tell
what was spoken of them. If anie see a scorpion, and saie this word
{Bud) he shall not be stoong or bitten therewith. These two Greeke
letters n and A written in a paper, and hoong about ones necke, pre-
serve the partie from bleereiednesse. Cummin orhempseed sowne with
curssing and opprobrious words grow the faster and the better. Berosus
Aniafius maketh witchcraft of great antiquitie : for he saith, that
Cham touching his fathers naked member uttered a charme, wherby
his father became emasculated or deprived of the powers generative.



1| A chartne teaching how to hurt whom you list with images of
wax, &^c.

MAke an image in his name, whom you would hurt or kill, of new
virgine wax ; under the right arme poke whereof place a swal-
lowes hart, and the liver under the left ; then hang about the necke
thereof a new thred in a new needle pricked into the member which you
would have hurt, with the rehearsall of certeine words, which for the
avoiding of foolish superstition and credulitie in this behalfe is to be
omitted. And if they were inserted, I dare undertake they would doo
no harme, were it not to make fooles, and catch gudgins. ^^ Other-
wise : Sometimes these images are made of brasse, and then the

the like image is made in the forme of a man or woman, upon whose
head is written the certeine name of the partie : and on his or hir
ribs these -words, A iltf, casyl, zaze, hitj mel meltai : then the same
must be buried. •^]^ Otherwise : In the dominion of Mars, two images
must be prepared, one of wax, the other of the earth of a dead man ;
each image must have in his hand a sword wherwith a man hath
beene slaine, & he that must be slaine may have his head thrust
through with a foine. In both must be written certeine peculiar
characters, and then must they be hid in a certeine place. -:>• Other-
wise : To obteine a womans love, an image must be made in the
houre of Venus, of virgine wax, in the name of the beloved, wher-
upon a character is written, & is warmed at a fier, and in dooing
therof the name of some angell must be mentioned. To be utterlie
rid of the witch, and to hang hir up by the haire, you must prepare
an image of the earth of a dead man to be baptised in another mans
name, whereon the name, with a character, must be written : then
must it be perfumed with a rotten bone, and then these psalmes read
backward: Doinine Domiiuts nosie?; Dominies illuininaiio niea, Donine
exaudi orationein meant, Deiis laudem 7neatn ne tacueris : and then
burie it, first in one place, and afterwards in another. Howbeit, it is
written in the 21 article of the determination of Paris, that to affirme
that images of brasse, lead, gold, of white or red wax, or of any
other stufife (conjured, baptised, consecrated, or rather execrated
through these magicall arts at certeine days) have woonderfull vertues,
or such as are avowed in their bookes or assertions, is error in faith,
naturall philosophic, and true astronomic : yea it is concluded in the
22 article of that councell, that it is as great an error to beleeve
those things, as to doo them.

But concerning these images, it is certeine that they are much
feared among the people, and much used among cousening witches,
as partlie appeereth in this discourse of mine else-where, & as partlie
you may see by the contents of this storie following. Not long
sithence, a yoong maiden (dwelling at new Romnie heere in Kent)
being the daughter of one M. L. Sttippenie (late Jurat of the same
towne but dead before the execution hereof) and afterwards the
wife of Thomas Eps, who is at this instant Maior oi Romjiie) was visited
with sicknesse, whose mother and father in lawe being abused with
credulitie concerning witches supernaturall power, repaired to a
famous witch called mother Baker, dwelling not far from thence at a
place called Stonstreet, who (according to witches cousening custome)
asked whether they mistrusted not some bad neighbour, to whom
they answered that indeed they doubted a woman neere unto them

them that there was great cause of their suspicion : for the same (said
she) is the verie partie that wrought the maidens destruction, by
making a hart of wax, and pricking the same with pins and needels ;
affirming also that the same neighbor of hirs had bestowed the
same in some secret corner of the house. This being beleeved, the
house w^as searched by credible persons, but nothing could be found.
The witch or wise woman being certified hereof, continued hir
assertion, and would needs go to the house where she hir selfe (as she
affirmed) would certeinlie find it. When she came thither, she
used hir cunning (as it chanced) to hir owne confusion, or at least wise
to hir detection : for heerein she did, as some of the wiser sort mis-
trusted that she woulde doo, laieng downe privilie such an image (as
she had before described) in a corner, which by others had beene
most diligentlie searched & looked into, & by that means hir cousen-
age was notablie bewraied. And I would wish that all witchmongers
might paie for their lewd repaire to inchantors, and consultation with
witches, and such as have familiar spirits, as some of these did, and
that by the order of the high commissioners, which partlie for respect
of neighborhood, .and partlie for other considerations, I leave un-

^ Charmes to find out a theefe.

THe meanes how to find out a theefe, is thus : Turne your face to
the east, and make a crosse upon christall with oile olive, and
under the crosse write these two words \_Saint Helen\^ Then a child
that is innocent, and a chast virgine borne in true wedlocke, and not
base begotten, of the age of ten yeares, must take the christall in his
hand, and behind his backe, kneeling on thy knees, thou must
devoutlie and reverentlie saie over this praier thrise : I beseech thee
my ladie S. Heleti, mother of king Constantine, which diddest find
the crosse whereupon Christ died : by that thy holie devotion, and
invention of the crosse, and by the same crosse, and by the joy
which thou conceivedst at the finding thereof and by the love which
thou barest to thy sonne Constantine, and by the great goodnes
which thou dooest alwaies use, that thou shew me in this christall,
whatsoever I aske or desire to knowe ; Amen. And when the child
seeth the angell in the christall, demand what you will, and the angell
will make answer thereunto. Memorandum,* that this be doone just
at the sunne rising, when the wether is faire and cleere.

Cardanus derideth these and such like fables, and setteth downe
his judgement therein accordinglie, in the sixteenth booke De rerum

which will shew unto you that shall looke thereinto, manie images

Bap. Neap, for the confection of such glasses. The subtilties hereof
are so detected, and the mysteries of the glasses so common now,

upon the particular confutation hereof. Cardanus in the place
before cited reporteth, how he tried with children these and diverse
circumstances the whole illusion, and found it to be plaine knaverie

part of the sheeres, holding it with the sive up from the ground apes, and
steddilie, and aske Peter and Paule whether A. B. or C. hath stolne
the thing lost, and at the nomination of the guiltie person, the sive
will turne round. This is a great practise in all countries, and in-
deed a verie bable. For with the beating of the pulse some cause of
that motion ariseth, some other cause by slight of the fingers, some
other by the wind gathered in the sive to be staid, &c : at the
pleasure of the holders. Some cause may be the imagination, which
upon conceipt at the naming of the partie altereth the common course
of the pulse. As may well be conceived by a ring held steddilie by a
thred betwixt the finger and the thombe, over or rather in a goblet or
glasse ; which within short space will strike against the side therof so
manie strokes as the holder thinketh it a clocke, and then will staie :

Furthermore, was it not in times of tempests the papists use, *or
superstition, to ring their belles against divels ; trusting rather to
the tonging of their belles, than to their owne crie unto God with
fasting and praier, assigned by him in all adversities and dangers :
according to the order of the Thracian preests, which would rore and
crie, with all the noise they could make, in those tempests. Olaus
Gothus saith, that his countriemen would shoot in the aire, to assist
their gods, whome they thought to be then togither by the eares with
others, and had consecrated arrowes, called Sagittcs foviales, even as
our papists had. Also in steed of belles, they had great hammers,
called Afallei Joviales, to make a noise in time of thunder. In some
countries they runne out of the doores in time of tempest, blessing
themselves with a cheese, whereupon there was a crosse made with
a ropes end upon ascension daie. Also three hailestones to be
throwne into the fier in a tempest, and thereupon to be said three
Pater nosters, and three Aves, S. Johns gospell, and in fine fttgiat
tempestas, is a present remedie. Item, to hang an eg laid on ascen-
sion daie in the roofe of the house, preserveth the same from all
hurts. *Item, I conjure you haile and wind by the five wounds of
Christ, by the three nailes which pearsed his hands and his feete,
and by the foure evangelists, Mattheiv, Afarke, Luke, andjohri, that
thou come downe dissolved into water. Item, it hath beene a usuall
matter, to carrie out in tempests the sacraments and relikes, &c.
Item, against stormes, and mania dumme creatures, the popish
church useth excommunication as a principal! charme. And now to
be delivered from witches themselves, they hang in their entries an
hearbe called pentaphyllon, cinquefole, also an olive branch, also
frankincense, myrrh, valerian, verven, palme, antirchmon, &c : also
haythorne, otherwise white[t]horne gathered on Male daie : also the
smoke of a lappoints fethers driveth spirits awaie. There be
innumerable popish exorcismes, and conjurations for hearbs and
other things, to be thereby made wholsome both for the bodies and
soules of men and beasts, and also for contagion of weather.
Memorandum,^ that at the gathering of these magicall herbs, the
Credo is necessarie to be said, as Vairus afifirmeth ; and also the

THe first chapter of S. foJins gospell in small letters consecrated

amulet or tablet, which delivereth from all witchcrafts and divelish
practises. But me thinkes, if one should hang a whole testament, or
rather a bible, he might beguile the divell terribhe. For indeed so
would S. Barnard have done, whom the divell told, that he could
shew him seven verses in the psalter, which being dailie repeated,
would of themselves bring anie man to heaven, and preserve him
from hell. But when S. Barnard deswed the divell to tell him which
they were, he refused, saieng, he might then thinke him a foole so to
prejudice himselfe. Well (quoth S. Bariiard) I will doo well enough
for that, for I will dailie saie over the whole psalter. The divell
hearing him saie so, told him which were the verses, least in reading

*\ Cures coftimensed and finished by witchcraft.

THere was a jollie fellovve that tooke upon him to be a notable
surgion, in the dutchie oi Mentz, 1567. to whom there resorted
a Gentleman that had beene vexed with sicknesse, named Elibert, zy^.
having a kerchiefe on his head, according to the guise of sicke folke.
But the surgion made him pull off his kerchiefe, and willed him to
drinke with him freelie. The sickeman said he durst not ; for he was
forbidden by physicke so to doo. Tush (said this cunning man) they
know not your disease : be ruled by me, and take in your drinke
lustilie. For he thought that when he was well tippled, he might the
more easilie beguile him in his bargaine, and make his reward the
greater, which he was to receive in part aforehand. When they had
well droonke, he called the sicke man aside, and told him the great-
nes and danger of his disease, and how that it grew by meanes of
witchcraft, and that it would be universallie spread in his house, and
among all his cattell, if it were not prevented : and impudentlie per-
suaded the sicke man to receive cure of him. And after bargaine The surgi-
made, he demanded of the sicke man, whether he had not anie at m"osnmpu-
home, whom he might assuredlie trust. The sicke man answered, denti'^set-

that he had a daughter and a servant. The cousener asked how old knavene
his daughter was ? The patient said, twentie. Well (said the ^^'^"'^ '
cousener) that is fit for our turne. Then he made the mother and father
to kneele on their knees to their daughter, and to desire hir in all
things to obey the physician, and that she would doo in everie thing
as he commanded hir ; otherwise hir father could not be restored to
his health. In which respect hir parents humblie besought hir on
their knees so to doo. Then he assigned hir to bring him into his
lodging hir fathers haire, and hir mothers, and of all those which he
kept in his house, as well of men and women, as also of his cattell.
When she came therewith unto him, according to the match made,
and hir parents commandement, he lead hir downe into a lowe parlor,

where having made a long speech, he opened a booke that laie on the
boord, and laieth thereon two knives acrosse, with much circumstance
of words. Then conjureth he, and maketh strange characters, and at
length he maketh a circle on the ground, whei-ein he causeth hir to
sticke one of those conjured knives ; and after manie more strange
words, he maketh hir sticke the other knife beside it. Then fell downe
the maid in a swoone for feare ; so as he was faine to frote hir and put
a sop into hir mouth, after the receipt whereof she was sore troubled
and amazed. Then he made hir brests to be uncovered, so as when
198- they were bare, he dalIied with them, diverslie and long together.
Then he made hir lie right upward, all uncovered and bare belowe
hir pappes. Wherein the maid being loth to obeie him, resisted, and
in shame forbad that villanie. Then said the knave ; Your fathers
destruction is at hand : for except you will be ruled, he and all his
familie shall susteine greater greefe and inconvenience, than is yet
happened unto him. And no remedie, except you will seeke his
utter overthrowe, I must have carnall copulation with you, and there-
withall fell into hir bosome, and overthrew hir and hir virginitie. So
did he the second daie, and attempted the like on the third daie.
But he failed then of his purpose, as the wench confessed after-
wards. In the meane time he ministred so cruell medicines to the
sicke man, that through the torments therof he feared present death,
and was faine to keepe his bed, whereas he walked about before
verie well and lustilie. The patient in his torments calleth unto
him for remedie, who being slacke and negligent in that behalfe,
made roome for the daughter to accompanie hir father, who asked
hir what she thought of the cure, and what hope she had of his
recoverie. Who with teares remained silent, as being oppressed
with greefe ; till at the last in abundance of sorrowe she uttered the
whole matter to hir father. This dooth Joliannes Wiems report,
saieng, that it came unto him by the lamentable relation of the
father himselfe. And this is here at this time for none other purpose
rehearsed, but that men may hereby learne to take heed of such

to be so cunning in witchcraft ; least they be bewitched : as maister

in his bellie by witchcraft. But being watched, so as he could not
conveie vipers into his ordure or excrements, after his purgations :
at length he told the partie, that he should suffer the paines of child-
birth, if it were not prevented ; and therefore he must put his hand
into his breech, and rake out those wormes there. But the mother
of the sicke partie having warning hereof, said she could doo that hir
selfe. So the cousener was prevented, and the partie died onelie of
a timpanie, and the knave ran awaie out of the countrie.

awaie by that meanes whereby it was brought. But Gofredus in-
veieth sore against the oppugners thereof. Pope Nicholas the fift
gave indulgence and leave to bishop Miraties (who was so bewitched
in his privities, that he could not use the gift of venerie) to seeke
remedie at witches hands. And this was the clause of his dispensa-
tion, Ut ex dnobus vialis fiigiatiir Jitajus, that of two evils, the greater
should be avoided. And so a witch, by taking his doublet, cured
him, and killed the other witch : as the storie saith, which is to be
seene in M. Mai. and diverse other writers.

Who are privileged from witches, what bodies are aptest to be
bewitched, or to be witches, why women are rather witches than
men, and what they are.

OW if you will know who and what persons are privileged
from witches, you must understand, that they be even
such as cannot be bewitched. In the number of whome
first be the inquisitors, and such as exercise publike
justice upon them. Howbeit,* a justice in Essex, whome for diverse
respects I have left unnamed, not long since thought he was be-
witched, in the verie instant whiles he examined the witch ; so as
his leg was broken thecby, &c : which either was false, or else this
rule untrue, or both rather injurious unto Gods providence. Second-

lie, such as observe dulie the rites and ceremonies of holie church,
and worship them with reverence, through the sprinkHng of holie
water, and receiving consecrated salt, by the lawfull use of candles
hallowed on Candelmas daie, and greene leaves consecrated on
Palme sundaie (which things they saie the church useth for the
qualifieng of the divels power) are preserved from witchcraft.
Thirdlie, some are preserved by their good angels, which attend and
wait upon them.

But I maie not omit here the reasons, which they bring, to prove
what bodies are the more apt and effectuall to execute the art of
fascination. And that is, first they saie the force of celestiall bodies,
which indififerentlie communicate their vertues unto men, beasts,
trees, stones, &c. But this gift and naturall influence of fascination
maie be increased in man, according to his affections and perturba-
tions ; as thorough anger, feare, love, hate, &c. For by hate (saith
Vairies) entereth a fierie inflammation into the eie of man, which
being violentlie sent out by beams and streames, &c : infect and be-
witch those bodies against whome they are opposed. And therefore
he saith (in the favour of women) that that is the cause why women
are oftener found to be witches than men. For (saith he) they
have such an unbrideled force of furie and concupiscence naturallie,
that by no meanes it is possible for them to temper or moderate the
same. So as upon everie trifling occasion, they (like brute beasts)
fix their furious eies upon the partie whom they bewitch. Hereby
it commeth to passe, that whereas women having a mervellous fickle
nature, what greefe so ever happeneth unto them, immediatlie all
peaceablenes of mind departeth ; and they are so troubled with
evill humors, that out go their venomous exhalations, ingendred
thorough their ilfavoured diet, and increased by meanes of their
pernicious excrements, which they expell. Women are also (saith
he) monethlie filled full of superfluous humors, and with them
the melancholike bloud boileth ; whereof spring vapors, and are
carried up, and conveied through the nosethrels and mouth, &c ; to
the bewitching of whatsoever it meeteth. For they belch up a
certeine breath, wherewith they bewitch whomsoever they list. And
of all other women, leane, hollow eied, old, beetlebrowed women
(saith he) are the most infectious. Marie he saith, that hot, subtill,
and thin bodies are most subject to be bewitched, if they be moist,
and all they generallie, whose veines, pipes, and passages of their
bodies are open. And finallie he saith, that all beautifull things
whatsoever, are soone subject to be bewitched ; as namelie goodlie
yoongmen, faire women, such as are naturallie borne to be rich, goodlie
beasts, faire horsses, ranke corne, beutifull trees, &c. Yea a freend

The xxi. Chapter,

What miracles witchmon^ers report to have beene done by witches
words, ^T'c : contradictions of witch7nongers a7notig themselves,
how beasts are cured her by, of bewitched butter, a char me against
witches, and a counter charme, the effect of charmes and words
■proved by L. Vairus to be woonderfull.

IJF I should go about to recite all charmes, I should take
an infinite worke in hand. For the witching writers
hold opinion, that anie thing almost maie be therby
brought to passe ; & that whether the words of the
charme be understandable or not, it skilleth not : so the charmer
have a steddie intention to bring his desire about. And then what
is it that cannot be done by words 1 For L. Vairus saith, that old
women have infeebled and killed children with words, and have
made women with child miscarrie ; they have made men pine awaie
to death, they have killed horsses, deprived sheepe of their milke,
*transformed men into beasts, flowne in the aire, tamed and staled
wild beasts, driven all noisome cattell and vermine from corne, vines
and hearbs, staled serpents, &c : and all with words. In so much
as he saith, that with certeine words spoken in a bulles eare by a
witch, the bull hath fallen downe to the ground as dead. Yea some
by vertue of words have gone upon a sharpe sword, and walked upon
hot glowing coles, without hurt ; with words (saith he) verie heavie
weights and burthens have beene lifted up ; and with words wild
horsses and wild bulles have beene tamed, and also mad dogs ; with
words they have killed wormes, and other vermine, and staled all
maner of bleedings and fluxes : with words all the diseases in mans
bodie are healed, and wounds cured ; arowes are with wonderfull
strangenesse and cunning plucked out of mens bones. Yea (saith
he) there be manie that can heale all bitings of dogs, or stingings of
serpents, or anie other poison : and all with nothing but words
spoken. And that which is most strange, he saith, that they can
remedie anie stranger, and him that is absent, with that verie sword
wherewith they are wounded. Yea and that which is beyond all



of Witchcraft.

admiration, if they stroke the sword upwards with their fingers, the
partie shall feele no paine : whereas if they drawe their finger
downewards thereupon, the partie wounded shall feele intollerable
paine. With a number of other cures, done altogither by the vertue
and force of words uttered and spoken.

Where, by the waie, I male not omit this speciall note, given by
M. Mai. to wit, that holie water male not be sprinkled upon be-
witched beasts, but must be powred into their mouthes. And yet he,
and also Nzde7', saie, that It is lawfull to blesse and sanctifie beasts,
as well as men ; both by charmes written, and also by holie words
spoken. For (saith Nider) if your cow be bewitched, three crosses,
three Pater nosters, and three Aves will certeinlie cure hir : and
likewise all other ceremonies ecclesiasticall. And this is a sure
Maxime* that they which are delivered from witchcraft by shrift, are
ever after in the night much molested (I beleeve by their ghostlie
fathers.) Also they loose their monie out of their pursses and
caskets : as M. Mai. saith he knoweth by experience. Also one
generall rule is given by M. Mai. to all butter wives, and dairie
maides, that they neither give nor lend anie butter, milke, or cheese,
to anie witches, which alwaies use to beg therof, when they meane
to worke mischeefe to their kine or whitmeats. Whereas indeed
there are in milke three substances commixted ; to wit, butter,
cheese, and whaie : if the same be kept too long, or in an evill
place, or be sluttishlie used, so as it be stale and sower, which hap-
peneth sometimes in 1 winter, but oftener in summer, when it is set
over the fier, the cheese and butter runneth togither, and congealeth,
so as it will rope like birdlime, that you male wind it about a sticke,
and in short space it will be so drie, as you male beate it to powder.
Which alteration being strange, is woondered at, and imputed to
witches. And herehence sometimes proceedeth the cause, why
butter commeth not, which when the countrie people see that it com-
meth not, then get they out of the suspected witches house, a little
butter, whereof must be made three balles, in the name of the holie
trinitie ; and so if they be put into the cherne, the butter will
presentlie come, and the witchcraft will cease ; Sic ars deltiditur arte.
But if you put a little sugar or sope into the cherne, among the
creame, the butter will never come : which is plaine witchcraft, if it
be closelie, cleanlie, and privilie handled. There be twentie severall
waies to make your butter come, which for brevitie I omit ; as to
bind your cherne with a rope, to thrust thereinto a red hot spit, &c :
but your best remedie and surest waie is, to looke well to your dairie
maid or wife, that she neither eat up the creame, nor sell awaie your
butter.

Lo this is their stuffe, mainteined to be at the least effectuall, if
not wholsome, by all papists and witchmongers, and speciallie of
the last and proudest writers. But to proove these things to be
effectuall, God knoweth their reasons are base and absurd. For
they write so, as they take the matter in question as granted, and 283.
by that meanes go awaie therewith. For L. Vairtis saith in the L.Vair.Ub.

matter, bicause a number of writers agree herein, and a number of
stories confirme it, and manie poets handle the same argument, and
in the twelve tables there is a lawe against it, and bicause the consent
of the common people is fullie with it, and bicause immoderate
praise is to be approoved a kind of witchcraft, and bicause old
women have such charmes and superstitious meanes as preserve
themselves from it, and bicause they are mocked that take awaie the
credit of such miracles, and bicause Salomon saith ; Fascinatio Sapj. a-
7nalignitatis obsctirat bona, and bicause the apostle saith ; O insensati Psai 119.
GalatcE^ quis vosfascinavit? And bicause it is written. Qui timent

distrust and detract anie thing from the credit of so manie grave
men, from histories, and common opinion of all men : he meaneth
in no wise to proove that there is miraculous working by witchcraft
and fascination ; and proceedeth so, according to his promise.

be preserved from bugges : neither that they looked into the foure

used such trades. Neither did Christ at anie time use or command

holie water, or crosses, &c : to be used as terrors against the divell,

who was not affraid to assault himselfe, when he was on earth. And

therefore a verie vaine thing it is to thinke that he feareth these

trifles, or anie externall matter. Let us then cast awaie these , -j-j^

The heathen philosophers shall at the last dale confound the
infidelitie and barbarous foolishnes of our christian or rather anti-

Incantanienta siait niulierctdarinii fignienta : so dooth Socrates (who

7'he signification of the Hebrue word Harttiinim., where it is fottnd
written in the scriptures, and how it is diverslie translated :
whereby the objection of Pharaos juagicians is afterward answered
in this booke J also of naturall magi eke not evil I in it selfe.

1'ARTUMIM is no naturall Hebrue word, but is borrowed
of some other nation : howbeit, it is used of the Hebrues
in these places ; to wit, Gen. 4. i. 8. 24. Exod. 7. 13. 24.
& 8. 7. 18. & 9. II. Dan. i, 20. & 2. 2. Hierome some-
times translateth it Co7ijectores, sometimes Malefci, sometimes
Arioli : which we for the most part translate by this word witches.
But the right signification heereof may be conceived, in that the
inchanters of Pharao, being magicians of Aegypt, were called Har-
tiimirn. And yet in Exodus they are named in some Latine trans-
lations Venefci. Rabbi Levi saith, it betokeneth such as doo strange
and woonderfull things, naturallie, artificiallie, and deceitfullie.
Rabbi Isaac Natar ai^rmtih, i\ia.\. SMch. were so termed, as amongst
the Gentiles professed singular wisedome. Aben Ezra expoundeth
it, to signifie such as knowe the secrets of nature, and the qualitie of
stones and hearbs, &c : which is atteined unto by art, and speciallie
by naturall magicke. But we, either for want of speach, or know-
lege, call them all by the name and terme of witches.

Certeinlie, God indueth bodies with woonderfull graces, the perfect
knowledge whereof man hath not reached unto : and on the one
side, there is amongst them such mutuall love, societie, and consent ;
and on the other side, such naturall discord, and secret enimitie, that
therein manie things are wrought to the astonishment of mans
capacitie. But when deceit and diabolicall words are coupled there-
with, then extendeth it to witchcraft and conjuration ; as whereunto
those naturall effects are falselie imputed. So as heere I shall have
some occasion to say somewhat of naturall magicke ; bicause under
it lieth hidden the venome of this word Hartuniitn. This art is said
by some to be the profoundnesse, and the verie absolute perfection
of naturall philosophie, and shewing foorth the active part thereof,
& through the aid of naturall vertues, by the convenient applieng of




of Witchcraft. chap. 2. 235

them, works are published, exceeding all capacitie and admiration ;
and yet not so much by art, as by nature. This art of it selfe is not
evill ; for it consisteth in searching foorth the nature, causes, and
effects of things. As farre as I can conceive, it hath beene more
corrupted and prophaned by us Christians, than either by Jewes or
Gentiles.



The second Chapter.

How the philosophers in times past travelled for the knowledge oj
naturall vingicke, of Saloiiions knowledge therein, who is to be
called a naturall magician, a distinction thereof and why it is

I AN IE philosophers ; as namely Plato, Pythagoras,
Empedocles, Democritiis, &c : travelled over all the
world, to find out & learne the knowlege of this art ; &
at their returne they preached and taught, professed
and published it. Yea, it should appeere by the magicians that
came to adore Christ, that the knowledge and reputation thereof 28g.
was greater, than we conceive or make account of But of all other,
Salomon was the greatest traveller in this art, as may appeere
throughout the booke of Ecclesiastcs : and speciallie in the booke of
Wisedome, where hee saith* God hath given me the true science of Sap. 7, 17

elements, the beginning and the end, and the middest of times, how ^°-

the times alter, and the change of seasons, the course of the yeare,
and the situation of the starres, the nature of living things, and the
furiousnesse of beasts, the power of the wind, and the imaginations
of men, the diversities of plants, and the vertues of roots, and all
things both secret and knowne, &c. Finallie, he was so cunning in ^'^

this art, that he is said to have bene a conjurer or witch, and is so ryy J«;'T''
reputed in the Romish church at this daie. Whereby you may see,
how fooles and papists are inclined to credit false accusations in
matters of; witchcraft and conjuration. The lesse knowledge we 204.
have in this art, the more we have it in contempt : in which respect
Plato saith trulie to Dioiiysitis ; They make philosophic a mockerie,
that deliver it to prophane and rude people. Certeinlie, the witch-
craft, conjuration, and inchantment that is imputed to 6'<^:(9;;^(7«, is Eccie. i.&r.

heed be taken) a student shall soone be abused. For manie (writing
by report, without experience) mistake their authors, and set downe
one thing for another. Then the conclusions being found false, the
experiment groweth into contempt, and in the end seemeth ridiculous,
though never so true. Plinie and Albert being curious writers
heerein, are often deceived ; insomuch as Plinie is called a noble
lier, and Albert a rusticall lier ; the one lieng by heeresaie, the other
by authoritie.

A magician is indeed that which the Latines call a wise man, as
Ahima Pompilius was among the Romans ; The Greeks, a philosopher,
as Socrates was among them ; the Aegyptians a preest, as Hermes
was ; the Cabalists called them prophets. But although these
2go. distinguished this art, accounting the one part thereof infamous, as
being too much given unto wicked, vaine, and impious curiositie, as
unto moovings, numbers, figures, sounds, voices, tunes, lights, affec-
tions of the mind, and words ; and the other part commendable, as
teaching manie good and necessarie things, as times and seasons to
sowe, plant, till, cut, &c : and diverse other things, which I will make
manifest unto you heereafter : yet we generallie condemne the whole
art, without distinction, as a part of witchcraft ; having learned to
hate it, before we knowe it ; affirming all to be witchcraft, which our
grosse heads are not able to conceive, and yet can thinke that an

and to be compassed none other waie, but onelie by witchcraft. And
yet in truth, naturall magicke is nothing else, but the worke of
nature. For in tillage, as nature produceth corne and hearbs ; so
art, being natures minister, prepareth it. Wherein times and seasons
are greatlie to be respected : for Annus non arviis prodiicit aristas.

But as mania necessarie and sober things are heerein taught : so
dooth it partlie (I saie) consist in such experiments and conclusions
as are but toies, but neverthelesse lie hid in nature, and being
unknowne, doo seeme miraculous, speciallie when they are inter-
medled and corrupted with cunning illusion, or legierdemaine, from
whence is derived the estimation of witchcraft. But being learned
and knowne, they are contemned, and appeere ridiculous : for that
onelie is woonderfull to the beholder, whereof he can conceive no
cause nor reason, according to the saieng of Ephesiics, Miraculum
solvilur itnde vidcttir esse iniracubim. And therefore a man shall
take great paines heerein, and bestow great cost to learne that which
is of no value, and a meere jugling knacke. Whereupon it is said,
that a man may not learne philosophic to be rich ; but must get
riches to learne philosophie : for to sluggards, niggards, & dizzards,
the secrets of nature are never opened. And doubtlesse a man may
gather out of this art, that which being published, shall set foorth
the glorie of God, and be many waies beneficiall to the common-
wealth : the first is doone by the manifestation of his works ; the
second, by skilfullie applieng them to our use and service.

Manie other things of lesse weight, being more secret

be true that J. Bap. Neap, and many other writers doo constantlie
affirme.) Tie a wild bull to a figtree, and he will be presentlie tame ;
or hang an old cocke thereupon, and he will immediatlie be tender ;
as also the feathers of an eagle consume all other feathers, if they
be intermedled together. Wherein it may not be denied, but nature
sheweth hir selfe a proper workwoman. But it seemeth unpossible,
that a little fish being but halfe a foot long, called Reniora or Remi-
ligo, or of some Echeneis, staieth a mightie ship with all hir loade 2g2.

bicause I see as strange effects of nature otherwise : as the propertie

776' incredible opcj'ation of waters., both standing and runninp; j of
wels, lakes, rivers, aiid of their woonderfull effects.

HE operation of waters, and their sundrie vertues are
also incredible, I meane not of waters compounded and
distilled : for it were endlesse to treate of their forces,
speciallie concerning medicines. But we have heere
even in England naturall springs, wels, and waters, both standing
and running, of excellent vertues, even such as except we had scene,
and had experiment of, we would not beleeve to be In rertan natiira.
And to let the physicall nature of them passe (for the which we
cannot be so thankefull to God, as they are wholsome for our bodies)
is it not miraculous, that wood is by the qualitie of divers waters
heere in England transubstantiated into a stone ? The which vertue
is also found to be in a lake besides the citie Masaca in Cappadocia,
there is a river called Scarniandrus, that maketh yellow sheepe.
Yea, there be manie waters, as in Pontns & Thessalia, and in the
land of Assyrides, in a river of Thracia (as Aristotle saith) that if
a white sheepe being with lambe drinke thereof, the lambe will be
blacke. Strabo writeth of the river called Crantes, in the borders of
Italic, running towards Tarenttini, where mens haire is made white
and yellow being washed therein. Plinie dooth write that of what
^93- colour the veines are under the rammes toong, of the same colour
or colours will the lambs be. There is a lake in a field called
Cornettis, in the bottome whereof manifestlie appeareth to the eie,
the carcases of snakes, ewts, and other serpents : whereas if you
put in your hand, to pull them out, you shall find nothing there.
There droppeth water out of a rocke in Arcadia, the which neither
a silverne nor a brasen boll can conteine, but it leapeth out, and
sprinkleth awaie ; and yet will it remaine without motion in the hoofe
of a mule. Such conclusions (I warrant you) were not unknowne to

Tlie vert lies aid qualities of siaidrie pretious stones, of coiiscnins:;
Lapidaries, &^c.

HE excellent vertiies and qualities of stones, found, con-
ceived and tried by this art, is woonderfull. Howbeit
many things most false and fabulous are added unto
their true effects, wherewith I thought good in part to
trie the readers patience and cunning withall. An Aggat (they saie)
hath vertue against the biting of scorpions or serpents. It is written
(but I will not stand to it) that it maketh a man eloquent, and pro-
cureth the favour of princes ; yea that the fume thereof dooth turne
awaie tempests. Alectorius is a stone about the bignesse of a beane,
as cleere as the christall, taken out of a cocks bellie which hath
beene gelt or made a capon foure yeares. If it be held in ones
mouth, it asswageth thirst, it maketh the husband to love the wife,
and the bearer invincible : for heereby Afio was said to overcome
his enimies. A crawpocke delivereth from prison. Chelidonius is
a stone taken out of a swallowe, which cureth melancholic : how-
beit, some authors saie, it is the hearbe wherbythe swallowes recover
the sight of their yoong, even if their eies be picked out with an
instrument. Geranites is taken out of a crane, and Draconites out
of a dragon. But it is to be noted, that such stones must be taken
out of the bellies of the serpents, beasts, or birds, (wherein they
are) whiles they live : otherwise, they vanish awaie with the life, and
so they reteine the vertues of those starres under which they are.
Amethysus maketh a droonken man sober, and refresheth the wit.
The* corrall presei'veth such as beare it from fascination or bewitch-
ing, and in this respect they are hanged about childrens necks. But
from whence that superstition is derived, and who invented the lie,
I knowe not : but I see how readie the people are to give credit
thereunto, by the multitude of corrals that waie emploied. I find
in good authors, that while it remaineth in the sea, it is an hearbe ;
and when it is brought thence, into the aire, it hardeneth, and
becommeth a stone.

Heliotropius stancheth bloud, driveth awaie poisons, preserveth
health : yea, and some write that it provoketh raine, and darkeneth
the sunne, suffering not him that beareth it to be abused. Hyacinthus
dooth all that the other docth, and also preserveth from lightening.
Dinothera hanged about the necke, collar, or yoke of any creature,
tameth it presentlie. A Topase healeth the lunatike person of his

passion of lunacie. Aitites, if it be shaken, soundelh as if there
were a little stone in the bellie thereof: it is good for the falling
sicknesse, and to prevent untimelie birth. Amethysus aforesaid
resisteth droonkenesse, so as the bearers shall be able to drinke
freelie, and recover themselves soone being droonke as apes : the
same maketh a man wise. Chalcedonius maketh the bearer luckie
in lawe, quickeneth the power of the bodie, and is of force also
against the illusions of the divell, and phantasticall cogitations
arising of melancholie. Corneolus mitigateth the heate of the mind,
and qualifieth malice, it stancheth bloudie fluxes, speciallie of women
that are troubled with their flowers. Heliotropius aforesaid darken-
eth the sunne, raiseth shewers, stancheth bloud, procureth good
fame, keepeth the bearer in health, and suffereth him not to be
deceived. If this were true, one of them would be deerer than a
thousand diamonds.

Hyacinthus deliveteth one from the danger of lightening, driveth
awaie poison and pestilent infection, and hath manie other vertues.
Iris helpeth a woman to speedie deliverance, and maketh raine-
bowes to appeere. A Saphire preserveth the members, and
maketh them livelie, and helpeth agues and gowts, and suffereth
not the bearer to be afraid : it hath vertue against venome, and
staieth bleeding at the nose being often put thereto. *A Smarag
is good for the eiesight, and suffereth not carnall copulation, it
maketh one rich and eloquent. A Topase increaseth riches, heal-
eth the lunatike passion, and stancheth bloud. Mephis (as Aaroft
and Hermes', report out of Alberhis Magnus) being broken into
powder, and droonke with water, maketh insensibilitie of torture.
Heereby you may understand, that as God hath bestowed upon these
stones, and such other like bodies, most excellent and woonderfull
virtues ; so according to the abundance of humane superstitions and
follies, manie ascribe unto them either more vertues, or others tlfan
they have : other boast that they are able to adde new qualities unto
them. And heerin consisteth a part of witchcraft and common
cousenage used sometimes of the Lapidaries for gaines ; sometimes
of others for cousening purposes. Some part of the vanitie heereof I
will heere describe, bicause the place serveth well therefore. And it
is not to be forgotten or omitted, that Pharos magicians were like
enough to be cunning therein.

Neverthelesse, I will first give you the opinion of one, who pro-
fessed himselfe a verie skilfull and well experimented Lapidarie, as
appeereth by a booke of his owne penning, published under this title
of Dactylotlieca, and (as I thinke) to be had among the bookesellers.
And thus followeth his assertion :

planets, and a due proportion of the elements, their substance being
a verie fine and pure compound, consisting of well tempered matter
wherein is no grosse mixture : as appeareth by plaine proofe oi India
and Aethopia, where the sunne being orient and meridionall, dooth
more effectuallie shew his operation, procuring more pretious stones
there to be ingendred, than in the countries that are Occident and
septentrionall. Unto this opinion doo diverse ancients accord ;

Isaac fudcEus, Zacharias Babylonicus, and manie more beside.

URIOUS Magicians afifirme, that these stones receive their
vertues altogether of the planets and heavenlie bodies,
and have not onelie the verie operation of the planets,
but sometimes the verie images and impressions of the
starres naturallie ingraffed in them, and otherwise ought alwaies to
have graven upon them, the similitudes of such monsters, beasts, and
other devises, as they imagine to be both internallie in operation, and
externallie in view, expressed in the planets. As for example, upon
the Achate are graven serpents or venomous beasts ; and some-
times a man riding on a serpent : which they know to he Aesculapius,
which is the celestiall serpent, whereby are cured (they saie) poisons
and stingings of serpents and scorpions. These grow in the river of
Achates, where the greatest scorpions are ingendred, and their
noisomnes is thereby qualified, and by the force of the scorpions the
stones vertue is quickened and increased. Also, if they would induce
love for the accomplishment of venerie, they inscribe and expresse in
the stones, amiable embracings and lovelie countenances and ges-
tures, words and kissings in apt figures. For the desires of the mind
are consonant with the nature of the stones, which must also be set

in rings, and upon foiles of such metals as have afifinitie with those
stones, thorough the operation of the planets vvhereunto they are
addicted, whereby they may gather the greater force of their working.

for so are they made with more life, and the influences and configura- bod. dactyl.
tions of the planets are made thereby the more to abound in them. As
if you will procure love, you must worke in apt, proper, and freendlie
aspects, as in the houre of Vefus, Ss^c : to make debate, the direct
contrarie order is to be taken. If you determine to make the image
of Venus., you must expect to be under Aquarius or Caprzcornus : for
Saiurne, Taurus, and Libra must be taken heed of. Manie other
observations there be, as to avoid the infortunate seate and place
of the planets, when you would bring a happie thing to passe, and
speciallie that it be not doone in the end, declination, or heele (as
they terme it) of the course thereof : for then the planet moorneth and
is dull.

Such signes as ascend in the daie, must be taken in the dale ; if
in the night they increase, then must you go to worke by night,
&c. For in Aries, Leo, and Sagittarie is a certeine triplicitie, wherein
the sunne hath dominion by dsae, Jupiter by night, and in the twie-
light the cold star of Saturne. But bicause there shall be no ex-
cuse wanting for the faults espied herein, they saie that the vertues
of all stones decaie through tract of time : so as such things are
not now to be looked for in all respects as are written. Howbeit
Jannes and Jambres were living in that time, and in no inconvenient
place ; and therefore not unlike to have that helpe towards the
abusing of PJiarao. Cardane saith, that although men attribute no H. Card. hb.

rities, honors, and favors of princes ; of Jupiter, riches and freends ;
of Venus, pleasures ; of Mars, boldnes ; of Mercicrie, diligence ; of
Saturne, patience and induring of labour ; of Luna, favour of
people : I am not ignorant (saith he) that stones doo good, and yet
I knowe the seales or figures doo none at all. And when Cardane zgg.
had shewed fullie that art, and the follie thereof, and the maner of H. Card. lib.
those terrible, prodigious, & deceitful! figures of the planets with i6. cap. 90!
their characters, &c. : he saith that those were deceitfull inventions
devised by couseners, and had no vertue indeed nor truth in them.
But bicause we spake somewhat even now of signets and seales, I
will shew you what I read reported by Vincentius in suo spcculo,
where making mention of the Jasper stone, whose nature and pro-

The freendlie societie betwixt a fox and a serpent is almost in-
credible : how loving the lizzard is to a man, we male read, though we
cannot see. Yet some affirme that our newt is not onlie like to the
lizzard in shape, but also in condition. From the which affection to-
wards a man, a spaniell doth not much differ, whereof I could cite
incredible stories. The amitie betwixt a castrell and a pigeon is much
noted among writers ; and speciallie how the castrell defendeth hir
from hir enimie the sparovvhawke : whereof they saie the doove
is not ignorant. Besides, the woonderfull operation and vertue of
hearbs, which to repeat were infinite : and therfore I will onlie referre
you to Mattheolus his herball, or to Dodoncctis. There is among them
such naturall accord and discord, as some prosper much the better
for the others companie, and some wither awaie being planted neere
unto the other. The lillie and the rose rejoise in ech others neigh-
borhood. The flag and the fernebush abhorre each other so much,
that the one can hardlie live besides the other. The cowcumber
loveth water, and hateth oile to the death. And bicause you shall not
saie that hearbs have no vertue, for that in this place I cite none, I
am content to discover two or three small qualities and vertues, which
are affirmed to be in hearbs : marie as simple as they be, Jannes and
Ja7nbres might have done much with them, if they had had them. If
you pricke out a yoong swallowes eies, the old swallow restoreth againe
their sight, with the application (they saie) of a little Celondine. Xan-
thus the author of histories reporteth, that a yoong dragon being
dead, was revived by hir dam, with an hearbe called
BaHm. AnAJuba saith, that a man in Arabia
being dead was revived by the

The bewitching venoine coiiteitied in the bodie of an harlot, how hir

HE vertue conteined within the bodie of an harlot, or

beheld with great admiration. For hir eie infecteth,
entiseth, and (if I maie so saie) bewitcheth them manie

people. Hir toong, hir gesture, hir behaviour, her beautie, and other
allurements poison and intoxicate the mind : yea, hir companie in-
duceth impudencie, corrupteth virginitie, confoundeth and consumeth
the bodies, goods, and the verie soules of men. And finallie hir
bodie destroieth and rotteth the verie flesh and bones of mans
bodie. And this is common, that we woonder not at all thereat, naie
we have not the course of the sunne, the moone, or the starres in so
great admiration, as the globe, counterfeting their order : which is in
respect but a bable made by an artificer. So as (I thinke) if Christ
himselfe had continued long in the execution of miracles, and had left
that power permanent and common in the church ; they would have
growne into contempt, and not have beene esteemed, according to his
owne saieng : A prophet is not regarded in his owne countrie. I
might recite infinite properties, wherewith God hath indued the bodie
of man, worthie of admiration, and fit for this place. As touching
other living creatures, God hath likewise (for his glorie, and our be-
hoofe) bestowed most excellent and miraculous gifts and vertues upon
their bodies and members, and that in severall and woonderfull wise.
We see that a bone taken out of a carps head, stancheth bloud, and
so doth none other part besides of that fish. The bone also in a hares
foot mitigateth the crampe, as none other bone nor part else of the

I am loath to be long in the description of circumstances, I will first
describe the thing it selfe : which was a peece of earth of a good
quantitie, and most excellentlie proportioned in nature, having these
qualities and vertues following. If one had taken a peece of perfect

field but feared it, and naturallie fled from the sight thereof. It would
be here to dale, and to morrovve twentie miles off, and the next dale

never a whit diminished, the forme thereof being inconstant, and at

told you that by the lumpe of earth a man is ment, and some of his
qualities described ; and that that which was conteined in the farre
fetcht stone, was fier, or rather flame : the doubt is resolved, and
the miracle ended. And yet (I confesse) there is in these two
creatures conteined more miraculous matter, than in all the load-
stones and diamonds in the world. And hereby is to be noted,
that even a part of this art, which is called naturall or witching
magicke, consisteth as well in the deceipt of words, as in the
sleight of hand : wherein plaine lieng is avoided with a figurative
speech, in the which, either the words themselves, or their interpreta-
tion have a double or doubtfull meaning, according to that which hath
beene said before in the title* Ob or Pytho : and shall be more at
large hereafter in this treatise manifested.

0 illusions, confederacies, and legie^'demaine, and how they may
be well or ill used.

ANIE writers have beene abused as well by untrue reports,
as by illusion, and practises of confederacie and legier-
demaine, &c : sometimes imputing unto words that which
resteth in the nature of the thing ; and sometimes to the
nature of the thing, that which proceedeth of fraud and deception of
sight. But when these experiments growe to superstition or impietie,
they are either to be forsaken as vaine, or denied as false. Howbeit,
if these things be doone for mirth and recreation, and not to the hurt
of our neighbour, nor to the abusing or prophaning of Gods name, in
mine opinion they are neither impious nor altogether unlawfull :
though herein or hereby a naturall thing be made to seeme super-
naturall. Such are the miracles wrought by jugglers, consisting in
fine and nimble conveiance, called legierdemaine : as when they seeme

some such other thing, when indeed they bestowe the same secretlie afiarg"\e-
into their bosoms or laps. Another point of juggling is, when they ginning at
thrust a knife through the braines and head of a chicken or pullet,
and seeme to cure the same with words : which would live and doo
well, though never a word were spoken. Some of these toies
also consist in arythmeticall devises, partlie in experiments of
naturall magike, and partlie in private as also in publike con-
federacie.

Of private confederacie, and of Brandons pigeon.

|RIVATE confederacie I meane, when one (by a speciall
plot laid by himselfe, without anie compact made with
others) persuadeth the beholders, that he will suddenlie
and in their presence doo some miraculous feat, which
he hath alredie accomplished privilie. As for example, he will shew
you a card, or anie other like thing : and will saie further unto
you ; Behold and see what a marke it hath, and then burneth it ;
and nevertheles fetcheth another like card so marked out of some
bodies pocket, or out of some corner where he himselfe before had
placed it ; to the woonder and astonishment of simple beholders,
which conceive not that kind of illusion, but expect miracles and
strange works.

What woondering and admiration was there at Brandon the Example
juggler, who painted on a wall the picture of a dove, and seeing a Ws woon-
pigeon sitting on the top of a house, said to the king ; Lo now '^'^'■■
your Grace shall see what a juggler can doo, if he be his craftes
maister ; and then pricked the picture with a knife so hard and so
often, and with so efifectuall words, as the pigeon fell downe from
the top of the house starke dead. I need not write anie further circum-
stance to shew how the matter was taken, what woondering was
thereat, how he was prohibited to use that feat anie further, least
he should emploie it in anie other kind of murther ; as though he,
whose picture so ever he had pricked, must needs have died, and so
the life of all men in the hands of a juggler : as is now supposed to
be in the hands and willes of witches. This storie is, untill the dale

some other such poison, which to the nature of the bird was so ex-

the space of halfe an houre, and being let lose after the medicine
ministred, she alwaies resorted to the top of the next house : which
she will the rather doo, if there be anie pigeons alreadie sitting there,
and (as it is alreadie said) after a short space falleth downe, either
Starke dead, or greatlie astonnied. But in the meane time the juggler
useth words of art, partlie to protract the time, and partlie to gaine

be done by an old woman, everie bodie would crie out for fier and

How men have beetle abused with words of eqtiivocatwn, with siindrie
examples thereof.

[|OME have taught, and others have written certeine ex-
periments ; in the expressing whereof they have used
such words of equivocation, as wherby manie have beene
overtaken and abused through rash credulitie : so as 310.
sometimes (I saie) they have reported, taught, and written that which
their capacitie tooke hold upon, contrarie to the truth and
sincere meaning of the author. It is a common jest among the water ■'^Jesta-

° JO mong \va-

men of the Thames, to shew the parish church of Stone to the passen- teimen
gers, calling the same by the name of the lanterne oiKent ; affirming, stone"'*^

afifirme and sweare, that in the same church is such continuall light, '^^'s-
that anie man may see to read there at all times of the night without
a candle.

An excellent philosopher, whome (for reverence unto his fame and
learning) I will forbeare to name, was overtaken by his hostesse at
Dover ; who merrilie told him, that if he could reteine and keepe in
his mouth certeine pibbles (lieng at the shore side) he should not per-
breake untill he came to Calice, how rough and tempestuous so ever
the seas were. Which when he had tried, and being not forced by
sicknes to vomit, nor to lose his stones, as by vomiting he must needs
doo, he thought his hostesse had discovered unto him an excellent
secret, nothing doubting of hir amphibologicall speech : and therefore
thought it a worthie note to be recorded among miraculous and
medicinable stones ; and inserted it accordinglie into his booke,
among other experiments collected with great industrie, learning,
travell, and judgement. All these toies helpe a subtill cousener to 219.
gaine credit with the multitude. Yea, to further their estimation,
manie will whisper prophesies of their owne invention into the eares of

311. by (if that were true, which either papists, conjurors, or witches
undertake to doo) we might dailie see the verie miracles wrought

How some are abused with naturall inagike, and sundrie examples
thereof when illusion is added thereunto, of facobs pied sheepe,
and of a blacke Moore.

UT as these notable and wonderfull experiments and con-
clusions that are found out in nature it selfe (through
wisedome, learning, and Industrie) doo greatlie oppose
and astonnish the capacitie of man : so (I saie) when
deceipt and illusion is annexed thereunto, then is the wit, the faith, &
constancie of man searched and tried. For if we shall yeeld that to
be divine, supernaturall, and miraculous, which we cannot compre-
hend ; a witch, a papist, a conjuror, a cousener, and a juggler may
make us beleeve they are gods : or else with more impietie we shall
ascribe such power and omnipotencie unto them, or unto the divell, as
onelie and properlie apperteineth to God. As for example. By con-
federacie or cousenage (as before I have said) I may seeme to manifest
the secret thoughts of the hart, which (as we learne in Gods booke)
none knoweth or searcheth, but God himselfe alone. And therfore,
whosoever beleeveth that I can doo as I may seeme to doo, maketh
a god of me, and is an idolater. In which respect, whensoever we
heare papist, witch, conjuror, or cousener, take upon him moi^e than
lieth in humane power to performe, we may know & boldlie saie it is
a knacke of knaverie ; and no miracle at all. And further we may
know, that when we understand it, it will not be woorth the knowing.
And at the discoverie of these miraculous toies, we shall leave to
wonder at them, and beginne to wonder at our selves, that could be so
abused with babies. Howbeit, such things as God hath laid up
secretlie in nature are to be weighed with great admiration, and to be

searched out with such industrie, as may become a christian man :

I meane, so as neither God, nor our neighbour be offended thereby, 220.

which respect doubtlesse y^wwiji' a.r\d Jambres never had. We find in

the scriptures diverse naturall and secret experiments practised ; as

namehe that of Jacobs for pied sheepe : which are confirmed by pi'o-

phane authors, and not oneHe verified in lambs and sheepe, but in

horsses, pecocks, connies, &c. We read also of a woman that brought

foorth a yoong blacke Moore, by meanes of an old blacke Moore who J- P"- '^"f

sathan and also Belzebiib had assisted them, could never have made
the serpent or the frogs of nothing, nor yet have changed the waters
with words. Neverthelesse, all the learned expositors of that place
affirme, that they made a shew of creation, «S:c : exhibiting by cunning
a resemblance of some of those miracles, which GOD wrought by the
hand oi Moses. Yea S. Atigustine and manie other hold, that

TRATO, Deniocritiis, Empedocles, and of late, Jo. Bap.

both from beast and also from fowle. Aristotle himselfe
teacheth to make a chicken have foure legs, and as manie
wings, onlie by a doubled yolked eg : whereby also a serpent may be
made to have manie legs. Or any thing that produceth egs, may
likewise be made double membred, or dismembred : & the viler
creature the sooner brought to monstrous deformitie, which in more
221. noble creatures is more hardlie brought to passe. There are also
prettie experiments of an eg, to produce anie fowle, without the
naturall helpe of the hen : the which is brought to passe, if the eg be
laid in the powder of the hens doong, dried and mingled with some of
the hens fethers, & stirred everie fourth houre. You may also pro-
duce (as they saie) the most venomous, noisome, and dangerous
serpent, called a cockatrice, by melting a little arsenicke, and the
poison of serpents, or some other strong venome, and drowning an eg
therein, which there must remaine certeine dales ; and if the eg be
set upright, the operation will be the better. This may also be
doone, if the eg be laid in doong, which of all other things giveth the
most singular and naturall heate : and as J. Bap. Neap, saith is
*Mirabilitim rerum parens ; who also writeth, that Crines fccmincE
jnenstruoscB are turned into serpents within short space : and he
further saith, that basill being beaten, and set out in a moist place,
betwixt a couple of tiles, dooth ingender scorpions. The ashes of a
ducke, being put betweene two dishes, and set in a moist place, dooth
ingender a huge tode : Quod etiajn efficit sanguis menstruosus. Manie
J14. writers conclude, that there be two maner of todes, the one bred by
naturall course and order of generation, the other growing of them-
selves, which are called temporarie, being onlie ingendred of shewers
and dust : and (as J. Bap. Neap, saith) they are easie to be made.
Plutarch and Heraclides doo saie, that they have seene these to
descend in raine, so as they have lien and cralled on the tops of
houses, &c. Also Aelianus dooth saie, that he sawe frogs and todes,
whereof the heads & shoulders were alive, & became flesh ; the
hinder parts being but earth, & so cralled on two feete, the other
being not yet fashioned or fullie framed. And Jlfacj-obius reporteth,

that in Aegypt, mice growe of earth and shewers ; as also frogs, todes,
and serpents in other places. They saie that Daiimatus Hispamis
could make them when & as manie as he listed. He is no good
angler, that knoweth not how soone the entrales of a beast, when they
are buried, will engender maggots (which in a civiler terme are called
gentles) a good bait for small fishes. Whosoever knoweth the order
of preserving silkewormes, may perceive a like conclusion : bicause
in the winter, that is a dead seed, which in the summer is a livelie
creature. Such and greater experiments might be knowne io Jannes
and Jambres, and serve well to their purpose, especiallie with such
excuses, delaies, and cunning, as they could joine therewithall. But
to proceed, and come a little neerer to their feats, and to shew you a
knacke beyond their cunning ; I can assure you that of the fat of a
man or a woman, lice are in verie short space ingendered : and yet I
saie, Pharaos magicians could not make them, with all the cunning
they had. Whereby you may perceive, that God indeed performed
the other actions, to indurate Piarao, though he thought his magicians
did with no lesse dexteritie than Moses worke miracles and woonders.
But some of the interpretors of that place excuse their ignorance in
that matter, thus ; The divell (saie they) can make no creature under
the quantitie of a barlie come, and lice being so little cannot therefore
be created by them. As though he that can make the greater, could
not make the lesse. A verie grosse absurditie. And as though
that he which hath power over great, had not the like over
small.

ments be true, it is no difficult matter to make it seeme so : and the
charme of a witch or papist joined with the experiment, will also make
the woonder seeme to proceed thereof. The words used in such case
are unccrteine, and to be recited at the pleasure of the witch or cou-
sener. But the conclusion is this : Cut off the head of a horsse or an
asse (before they be dead) otherwise the vertue or strength thereof
will be the lesse effectuall, and make an earthern vessell of fit
capacitie to conteine the same, and let it be filled with the oile and
fat therof ; cover it close, and dawbe it over with lome : let it
boile over a soft fier three dales continuallie, that the flesh boiled
may run into oile, so as the bare bones may be scene : beate the
haire into powder, and mingle the same with the oile ; and annoint
the heads of the standers by, and they shall seeme to have horsses or
asses heads. If beasts heads be annointed with the like oile made of
a mans head, they shall seeme to have mens faces, as diverse authors
soberlie affirme. If a lampe be annointed heerewith, everie thing shall
seeme most monstrous. It is also written, that if that which is called

316. Spernia in anie beast be burned, and anie bodies face therewithal!
annointed, he shall seeme to have the like face as the beast had.
But if you beate arsenicke verie fine, and boile it with a little sulphur
in a covered pot, and kindle it with a new candle, the standers by will
seeme to be hedlesse. Aqua composita and salt being fiered in the
night, and all other lights extinguished, make the standers by seeme
as dead. All these things might be verie well perceived and knowne,
and also practised by J amies and Jambres. But the woonderous
devises, and miraculous sights and conceipts made and conteined in
glasse, doo farre exceed all other ; whereto the art perspective is verie
necessarie. For it sheweth the illusions of them, whose experiments
be seene in diverse sorts of glasses ; as in the hallowe, the plaine, the
embossed, the columnarie, the pyramidate or piked, the turbinall,
the bounched, the round, the cornerd, the inversed, the eversed, the
massie, the regular, the irregular, the coloured and cleare glasses :
for you may have glasses so made, as what image or favour soever
you print in your imagination, you shall thinke you see the same
therein. Others are so framed, as therein one may see what others

223. doo in places far distant ; others, wherby you shall see men hanging
in the aire ; others, whereby you may perceive men flieng in the
aire ; others, wherin you may see one comming, & another going ;
others, where one image shall seeme to be one hundred, &c. There
be glasses also, wherein one man may see another mans image, and
not his owne ; others, to make manie similitudes ; others, to make none
at all. Others, contrarie to the use of all glasses, make the right side
turne to the right, and the left side to the left ; others, that burne before

but cast them farre ofif in the aire, appearing Uke aierie images, and
by the collection of sunne beames, with great force setteth fier (verie
farre off) in everie thing that may be burned. There be cleare glasses,
that make great things seeme little, things farre off to be at hand ;
and that which is neere, to be far off ; such things as are over us, to
seeme under us ; and those that are under us, to be above us. There are
some glasses also, that represent things in diverse colours, & them
most gorgeous, speciallie any white thing. Finally, the thing most
worthie of admiration concerning these glasses, is, that the lesser
glass dooth lessen the shape : but how big so ever it be, it maketh the
shape no bigger than it is. And therfore Atigustine thinketh some
hidden mysterie to be therein. Vitellhis, and J. Bap. Neap, write
largelie hereof. These I have for the most part seene, and have the
receipt how to make them : which, if desire of brevitie had not for-
bidden me, I would here have set downe. But I thinke not but
Pharaos magicians had better experience than I for those and such
like devises. And (as Poiiipanacius saith) it is most true, that some
for these feats have beene accounted saints, some other witches. And
therefore I saie, that the pope maketh rich witches, saints ; and
burneth the poore witches.

A comparison betwixt Pharaos magicians and our witches, and how
their cunning consisted in jtcggling knacks.

JHUS you see that it hath pleased GOD to shew unto men
that seeke for knowledge, such cunning in finding out,
compounding, and framing of strange and secret things,
as thereby he seemeth to have bestowed upon man, some
part of his divinitie. Howbeit, God (of nothing, with his word) hath
created all things, and dooth at his will, beyond the power and also
the reach of man, accomplish whatsoever he list. And such miracles
in times past he wrought by the hands of his prophets, as here he did
by Moses in the presence of Pharao, which Jannes and Janibres
apishlie followed. But to affirme that they by themselves, or by all
the divels in hell, could doo indeed as Moses did by the power of the
Holie-ghost, is woorsse than infidelitie. If anie object and saie, that
our witches can doo such feats with words and charms, as Pharaos
magicians did by their art, I denie it ; and all the world will never be

able to shew it. That which they did, was openlie done ; as our
witches and conjurors never doo anie thing: so as these cannot doo
as they did. And yet (as Calvine saith of them) they were but
jtS". jugglers. Neither could they doo, as manie suppose. For as
elements saith ; These magicians did rather seeme to doo these
woonders, than worke them indeed. And if they made but prestigious
shewes of things, I saie it was more than our witches can doo. For
witchcrafts (as Erastus himselfe confesseth in drift of argument) are
but old wives fables. If the magicians serpent had beene a verie
serpent, it must needs have beene transformed out of the rod. And
therein had beene a double worke of God ; to wit, the qualifieng and
extinguishment of one substance, and the creation of another. Which
are actions beyond the divels power, for he can neither make a bodie
to be no bodie, nor yet no bodie to be a bodie ; as to make something
nothing, and nothing something ; and contrarie things, one : naie,
they cannot make one haire either white or blacke.* If Pharaos
magicians had made verie frogs upon a sudden, whie could they not
drive them awaie againe? It they could not hurt the frogs, whie
should we thinke that they could make them ? Or that our witches,
which cannot doo so much as counterfet them, can kill cattell and other
creatures with words or wishes ? And therefore I saie with Javiblichiis,

That the serpents and frogs were tritlie presented, and the water

RUELIE I thinke there were no inconvenience granted,
though I should admit that the serpent and frogs were
truelie presented, and the water truelie poisoned hyfatutes
and fanibrcs ; not that they could execute such miracles of
themselves, or by their familiars or divels : but that God, by the hands
of those counterfet couseners, contrarie to their owne expectations, over-
tooke them, and compelled them in their ridiculous wickednes to be
instruments of his will and vengeance, upon their maister Pharao :
so as by their hands God shewed some miracles, which he himselfe

wrought : as appeareth in Exodus. For God did put the spirit of
truth into Baalams mouth, who was hiered to cursse his people.
And ahhough he were a corrupt and false prophet, and went about a
mischeevous enterprise ; yet God made him an instrument (against
his will) to the confusion of the wicked. Which if it pleased God
to doo here, as a speciall worke, whereby to shew his omnipotencie,
to the confirmation of his peoples faith, in the doctrine of their
Messias delivered unto them by the prophet Moses, then was it
miraculous and extraordinarie, and not to be looked for now. And
(as some suppose) there were then a consort or crew of false prophets,
which could also foretell things to come, and worke miracles. I
answer, it was extraordinarie and miraculous, & that it pleased God
so to trie his people ; but he worketh not so in these dales : for the
working of miracles is ceased. Likewise in this case it might well
stand with Gods glorie, to use the hands of PJiaraos magicians,
towards the hardening of their maisters hart ; and to make their
illusions and ridiculous conceipts to become effectuall. For God had
promised and determined to harden the heart of Pharao. As for the
miracles which Moses did, they mollified it so, as he alwaies relented
upon the sight of the same. For unto the greatnesse of his miracles
were added such modestie and patience, as might have mooved even
a heart of Steele or flint. But Pharaos frowardnes alwaies grew upon
the magicians actions : the like example, or the resemblance whereof,
we find not againe in the scriptures. And though there were such
people in those daies suffered and used by God, for the accomplish-
ment of his will and secret purpose : yet it foUoweth not, that now,
when Gods will is wholie revealed unto us in his word, and his sonne
exhibited (for whome, or rather for the manifestation of whose
comming all those things were suffered or wrought) such things and
such people should yet continue. So as I conclude, the cause being
taken awaie, the thing proceeding thence remaineth not. And to
assigne our witches and conjurors their roome, is to mocke and
contemne Gods woonderfull works ; and to oppose against them
cousenages, juggling knacks, and things of nought. And therefore,
as they must confesse, that none in these daies can doo as Moses
did : so it may be answered, that none in these daies can doo as
Jannes and Jambres did : who, if they had beene false prophets, as
they were jugglers, had yet beene more privileged to exceed our old
women or conjurors, in the accomplishing of miracles, or in prophe-
sieng, &c. For who may be compared with Balaam ? Naie, I dare
saie, that Balaams asse wrought a greater miracle, and more super-
naturall, than either the pope or all the conjurors and witches in
the world can doo at this dale.

To conclude, it is to be avouched (and there be proofes manifest
enough) that our jugglers approch much neerer to resemble PJiaraos
magicians, than either witches or conjurors, & can make a more
livelie shew of working miracles than anie inchantors can doo : for
these practise to shew that in action, which witches doo in words and
termes. But that you may thinke I have reason for the maintenance
of mine opinion in this behalfe, I will surcease by multitude of words
to amplifie this place, referring you to the tract following of the art
of juggling, where you shall read strange practises and cunning
conveiances ; which bicause they cannot so convenientlie be de-
scribed by phrase of speech, as that they should presentlie sinke into
the capacitie of you that would be practitioners of the same ; I have
caused them to be set foorth in forme and figure, that your under-
standing might be somewhat helped by instrumentall demonstrations.
And when you have perused that whole discoverie of juggling,
compare the wonders thereof with the woonders imputed to conjurors
and witches, (not omitting PJiaraos sorcerers at anie hand in this
comparison) and I beleeve you will be resolved, that the miracles
doone in Pharaos sight by them, and the miracles ascribed unto
witches, conjurors, &c : may be well taken for false miracles, meere
delusions, &c : and for such actions as are commonlie practised by
cunning jugglers ; be it either by legierdemaine, confederacie, or
otherwise.

I OW because such occasion is ministred, and the matter
so pertinent to my purpose, and also the life of witch-
craft and cousenage so manifestlie delivered in the art
of juggling ; I thought good to discover it, together with
the rest of the other deceiptfull arts ; being sorie that it falleth out
to my lot, to laie open the secrets of this mysterie, to the hinderance
of such poore men as live thereby : whose dooings herein are not
onlie toUerable, but greatlie commendable, so they abuse not the
name of God, nor make the people attribute unto them his power ;
but alwaies acknowledge wherein the art consisteth, so as thereby
the other unlawfull and impious arts may be by them the rather
detected and bewraied.

Chap. 23.



The true art therefore of juggling consisteth in legierdemaine ; to
wit, the nimble conveiance of the hand, which is especiallie per-
formed three waies. The first and principall consisteth in hiding and
conveieng of balles, the second in the alteration of monie, the third
in the shuffeling of the cards. He that is expert in these may shew
much pleasure, and manie feats, and hath more cunning than all
other witches or magicians. All other parts of this art are taught
when they are discovered : but this part cannot be taught by any
description or instruction, without great exercise and expense of
time. And for as much as I professe rather to discover than teach
these mysteries, it shall suffice to signifie unto you, that the endevor
and drift of jugglers is onelie to abuse mens eies and judgements.
Now therefore my meaning is, in words as plaine as I can, to rip up
certeine proper tricks of that art ; whereof some are pleasant and
delectable, other some dreadfull and desperate, and all but meere
delusions, or counterfet actions, as you shall soone see by due obser-
vation of everie knacke by me heereafter deciphered.

Of the ball, and the inan7ter of legierdemaine therewith, also
notable feats with one or diverse balles.

ONCERNING the ball, the plaies & devises thereof are
infinite, in somuch as if you can by use handle them
well, you may shewe therewith a hundreth feats. But
whether you seeme to throw the ball into your left hand,
or into your mouth, or into a pot, or up into the aier, &c : it is to be
kept still in your right hand. If you practise first with a leaden
bullet, you shall the sooner and better doo it with balles of corke.
The first place at your first learning, where you are to bestow a great
ball, is in the palme of your hand, with your ringfinger : but a small
ball is to be placed with your thombe, betwixt your ringfinger and
midlefinger, then are you to practise to doo it betwixt the other
fingers, then betwixt the forefinger and the thombe, with the forefinger
and midlefinger jointlie, and therein is the greatest and strangest
cunning shewed. Lastlie the same small ball is to be practised in
the palme of the hand, and by use you shall not onelie seeme to put
anie one ball from you, and yet reteine it in your hand ; but you
shall keepe foure or five as cleanelie and certeinelie as one. This
being atteined unto, you shall worke woonderfull feats : as for
example.

Laie three or foure balles before you, and as manie small candle-
sticks, boUes, saltsellers, or saltseller covers, which is the best.
Then first seeme to put one ball into your left hand, and therwithall
seeme to hold the same fast : then take one of the candlesticks,
or anie other thing (having a hollow foot, & not being too great) and
seeme to put the ball which is thought to be in your left hand, under-
neath the same, and so under the other candlesticks seeme to bestow
the other balles : and all this while the beholders will suppose each
ball to be under each candlesticke : this doone, some charme or
forme of words is commonlie used. Then take up one candlesticke
3^3' with one hand, and blow, saieng ; Lo, you see that is gone : & so
likewise looke under ech candlesticke with like grace and words, &
the beholders will woonder where they are become. But if you, in
lifting up the candlesticks with your right hand, leave all those three
or foure balles under one of them (as by use you may easilie doo,
having turned them all downe into your hand, and holding them fast
with your little and ringfingers) and take the candlesticke with your
other fingers, and cast the balles up into the hollownes thereof (for
so they will not roll so soone awaie) the standers by will be much
astonied. But it will seeme woonderfull strange, if also in shewing
how there remaineth nothing under an other of those candlesticks,
taken up with your left hand, you leave behind you a great ball, or
anie other thing, the miracle will be the greater. For first they
thinke you have pulled awaie all the balles by miracle ; then, that
you have brought them all togither againe by like meanes, and they
neither thinke nor looke that anie other thing remaineth behind under
anie of them. And therefore, after manie other feats doone, returne
to your candlesticks, remembring where you left the great ball, and
in no wise touch the same ; but having an other like ball about you,
seeme to bestow the same in maner and forme aforesaid, under a
candlesticke which standeth furthest fr5 that where the ball lieth.
And when you shall with *words or charmes seeme to conveie the
same ball from under the same candlesticke, and afterward bring it
under the candlesticke which you touched not, it will (I saie) seeme
woonderfull strange.



To make a little ball swell hi your hand till it be verie great.



TAke a verie great ball in your left hand, or three indifferent big
balles ; and shewing one or three little balles, seeme to put
them into your said left hand, concealing (as you may well doo) the
other balles which were there in before : then use words, and make

them seeme to swell, and open your hand, &c. This plaie is to be
varied a hundreth waies : for as you find them all under one candle-
sticke, so may you go to a stander by, and take off his hat or cap,
and shew the balles to be there, by conveieng them thereinto, as you
turne the bottome upward.



228.



To consume {or rather to conveie) one or manie balles into
nothing.

IF you take one ball, or more, & seeme to put it into your other
hand, and whilest you use charming words, you conveie them
out of your right hand into your lap ; it will seeme strange. For
when you open your left hand immediatlie, the sharpest lookers on
will saie it is in your other hand, which also then you may open ; &
when they see nothing there, they are greatlie overtaken.

But I will leave to speake anie more of the ball, for herein I might

it : but certeinelie manie are persuaded that it is a spirit or a flie,

To cofiveie 7nonie out of one of your hands into the other by
3^5- legierdemaine.

First you must hold open your right hand, & lay therin a tester, or
some big peece of monie : then laie thereupon the top of your
long left finger, and use words, and upon the sudden slip your right
hand from your finger wherwith you held downe the testor, and bend-
ing your hand a verie little, you shall reteine the testor still therein :
and suddenlie (I saie) drawing your right hand through your left, you
shall seeme to have left the testor there speciallie when you shut in
due time your left hand. Which that it may more plainelie appeare
229. to be trulie doone, you may take a knife, and seeme to knocke against
it, so as it shall make a great sound : but in stead of knocking the
peece in the left hand (where none is) you shall hold the point of the
knife fast with the left hand, and knocke against the testor held in
the other hand, and it will be thought to hit against the mony in the
left hand. Then use words, and open your hand, and when nothing
is seene, it will be woondered at how the testor was remooved.



To convert or transubstantiate monie into cotmters, or counters
into monie.

ANother waie to deceive the lookers on, is to doo as before, with
a testor ; and keeping a counter in the palme of the left hand
secretlie to seeme to put the testor thereinto ; which being reteined
still in the right hand, when the left hand is opened, the testor will
seeme to be transubstantiated into a counter.

conceipts by that meanes, and may reserve two or three as well as
one. And lo then may you seeme to put one peece into your left
hand, and reteining it still in your right hand, you may togither
therewith take up another like peece, and so with words seeme to
bring both peeces togither.



of Witchcraft. chap. 24. 267



To put one testor into a strangers hafid, and another into
your owne, and to conveie both into the strangers hand with
words.

ALso you may take two testers evenlie set togither, and put the
same in stead of one testor, into a strangers hand, and then
making as though you did put one testor into your left hand, with
words you shall make it seeme that you conveie the testor in your
hand, into the strangers hand : for when you open your said left
hand, there shall be nothing scene ; and he opening his hand shall
find two, where he thought was but one. By this devise (I saie) a
hundreth conceipts may be shewed.



How to doo the same or the Ukefeate otherwise.

TO keepe a testor, &c : betwixt your finger, serveth speciallie for
this and such like purposes. Hold out your hand, and cause
one to laie a testor upon the palme thereof, then shake the same up
almost to your fingers ends, and putting your thombe upon it ; you
shall easilie, with a little practise, conveie the edge betwixt the middle
and forefinger, whilest you proffer to put it into your other hand you must

Juggler also sometimes will borrow a groat or a testor, &c : and
marke it before you, and seeme to put the same into the mid-
dest of a handkercher, and wind it so, as you may the better see and
feele it. Then will he take you the handkercher, and bid you feele
whether the groat be there or naie ; and he will also require you to
put the same under a candlesticke, or some such thing. Then will
he send for a bason, and holding the same under the boord right
against the candlesticke, will use certeine words of inchantments ;
and in short space you shall heare the groat fall into the bason. This
doone, one takes off the candlesticke, and the juggler taketh the
handkercher by a tasseil, and shaketh it ; but the monie is gone :
which seemeth as strange as anie feate whatsoever, but being knowne,
the miracle is turned to a bable. For it is nothing else, but to sowe
a groat into the corner of a handkercher, finelie covered with a peece
of linnen, little bigger than your groat : which corner you must con-
veie in steed of the groat delivered to you, into the middle of your
231. handkercher ; leaving the other either in your hand or lap, which

into a bason, &c.

A notable tricke to transforme a counter to a groat.

thin at the one side ; and take two counters, and grind them,
the one at the one side, the other on the other side : glew the smooth

side of the groat to the smooth side of one of the counters, joining
them so close together as may be, speciallie at the edges, which may
be so filed, as they shall seeme to be but one peece ; to wit, one side
a counter, and the other side a groat. Then take a verie little greene
waxe (for that is softest and therefore best) and laie it so upon the
smooth side of the other counter, as it doo not much discolour the
groat : and so will that counter with the groat cleave togither, as
though they were glewed ; and being filed even with the groat and
the other counter, it will seeme so like a perfect entire counter, that
though a stranger handle it, he shall not bewraie it ; then having a
little touched your forefinger, and the thombe of your right hand
with soft waxe, take therewith this counterfet counter, and laie it
downe openlie upon the palme of your left hand, in such sort as an
auditor laieth downe his counters, wringing the same hard, so as you
may leave the glewed counter with the groat apparentlie in the palme
of your left hand ; and the smooth side of the waxed counter will
sticke fast upon your thombe, by reason of the wax wherwith it is
smeered, and so may you hide it at your pleasure. Provided alwaies,
that you laie the waxed side downeward, and the glewed side upward:
then close your hand, and in or after the closing thereof turne the
peece, & so in stead of a counter (which they suppose to be in your
hand) you shall seeme to have a groat, to the astonishment of the
beholders, if it be well handled.

Note.




||AVING now bestowed some waste monie among you, I
will set you to cards ; by which kind of witchcraft a
great number of people have juggled awaie not onelie
their monie, but also their lands, their health, their
time, and their honestie. I dare not (as I could) shew the lewd
juggling that chetors practise, least it minister some offense to the
well disposed, to the simple hurt and losses, and to the wicked
occasion of evill dooing. But I would wish all gamesters to beware,
not onlie with what cards and dice they plaie, but speciallie with
whome & where they exercise gaming. And to let dice passe (as
whereby a man male be inevitablie cousened) one that is skilfull to
make and use Bumcards, may undoo a hundreth wealthie men that
are given to gaming : but if he have a confederate present, either of
the plaiers or standers by, the mischiefe cannot be avoided. If you
plaie among strangers, beware of him that seemes simple or drunken ;
for under their habit the most speciall couseners are presented, &
while you thinke by their simplicitie and imperfections to beguile
them (and therof perchance are persuaded by their confederats, your
verie freends as you thinke) you your selfe will be most of all over-
taken. Beware also of bettors by, and lookers on, and namelie of
them that bet on your side : for whilest they looke in your game
without suspicion, they discover it by signes to your adversaries, with
whome they bet, and yet are their confederates.

But in shewing feats, and juggling with cards, the principall point
consisteth in shuffling them ninjblie, and alwaies keeping one certeine
card either in the bottome, or in some knowne place of the stocke,
foure or five cards from it. Hereby you shall seeme to worke woon-
ders ; for it will be easie for you to see or spie one card, which
though you be perceived to doo, it will not be suspected, if you
shuffle them well afterwards. And this note I must give you, that in
reserving the bottome card, you must alwaies (whilest you shuffle)
keepe him a little before or a little behind all the cards lieng under-
neath him, bestowing him (I saie) either a little beyond his fellowes
before, right over the forefinger, or else behind the rest, so as the little

finger of the left hand may meete with it : which is the easier, the
readier, and the better waie. In the beginning of your shuffling, shuffle
as thicke as you can ; and in the end throw upon the stocke the nether
card (with so manie mo at the least as you would have preserved for
anie purpose) a little before or behind the rest. Provided alwaies, that

packe lie behind, creepe up to meete with the bottome card, and not lie 333.
betwixt the cards : and when you feele it, you may there hold it, untill
you have shuffled over the cards againe, still leaving your kept card be-
low. Being perfect herein, you may doo almost what you list with the
cards. By this meanes, what packe soever you make, though it
consist of eight, twelve, or twentie cards, you may keepe them still
together unsevered next to the nether card, and yet shuffle them often
to satisfie the curious beholders. As for example, and for brevities
sake, to shew you diverse feats under one.



How to deliver outfoure aces, and to convert them into
foure knaves.

MAke a packe of these eight cards ; to wit, foure knaves and
foure aces : and although all the eight cards must lie immedi-
atlie together, yet must ech knave and ace be evenlie severed, and
the same eight cards must lie also in the lowest place of the bunch.
Then shuffle them so, as alwaies at the second shuffling, or at least
wise at the end of your shuffling the said packe, and of the packe one
ace may lie nethermost, or so as you may know where he goeth and
lieth : and alwaies (I saie) let your foresaid packe with three or foure
cardsmorelie unseparablie together immediatlie upon and with that ace.
Then using some speech or other devise, and putting your hands with
the cards to the edge of the table to hide the action, let out privilie a
peece of the second card, which is one of the knaves, holding foorth
the stocke in both your hands, and shewing to the standers by the
nether card (which is the ace or kept card) covering also the head or
peece of the knave (which is the next card) with your foure fingers,
draw out the same knave, laieng it downe on the table : then shuffle
againe, keeping your packe whole, and so have you two aces lieng
together in the bottome. And therfore, to reforme that disordered
card, as also for a grace and countenance to that action, take off the
uppermost card of the bunch, and thrust it into the middest of the
cards ; and then take awaie the nethermost card, which is one of your
said aces, and bestow him likewise. Then may you begin as before,
shewing an other ace, and in steed thereof, laie downe an other knave:
and so foorth, untill in steed of foure aces you have laied downe foure

you are taught, till your card lie againe below in the bottome. Then

IF you can see no card, or be suspected to have seene that which
you meane to shew, then let a stander by first shuffle, and after-
wards take you the cards into your hands, and (having shewed and
not seene the bottome card) shuffle againe, and keepe the same card,
as before you are taught ; and either make shift then to see it when
their suspicion is past, which male be done by letting some cards fall,
or else laie downe all the cards in heaps, remembring where you laid
your bottome card. Then spie how manie cards lie in some one
heape, and laie the heape where your bottome card is upon that
heape, and all the other heapes upon the same : and so, if there were
five cards in the heape wheron you laied your card, then the same
must be the sixt card, which now you may throw out, or looke upon
without suspicion : and tell them the card they saw.

your confederate thinke that card which you have in your nut, &c :
and either conveie the same nut or cheristone into some bodies
pocket, or laie it in some strange place : then make one drawe the
same out of the stocke held in your hand, which by use you may
well doo. But saie not ; I will make you perforce draw such a
card ; but require some stander by to draw a card, saieng that it
skils not what card he draw. And if your hand serve you to use
the cards well, you shall prefer unto him, and he shall receive (even
though he snatch at an other) the verie card which you kept, and
your confederate thought, and is written in the nut, and hidden in
the pocket, &c. You must (while you hold the stocke in your hands,
tossing the cards to and fro) remember alwaies to keepe your card
in your eie, and not to loose the sight thereof. Which feate, till
you be perfect in, you may have the same privilie marked ; and when
you perceive his hand readie to draw, put it a little out towards his
hand, nimblie turning over the cards, as though you numbred them,
holding the same more loose and open than the rest, in no wise suffer-
ing him to draw anie other : which if he should doo, you must let three
or foure fall, that you may beginne againe. II This will seeme most
strange, if your said paper be inclosed in a button, and by confederacie
sowed upon the doublet or cote of anie bodie. This tricke they com-
monlie end with a nut full of inke, in which case some wag or unhappie
boie is to be required to thinke a card ; and having so doone, let the
nut be delivered him to cracke, which he will not refuse to doo, if he

will it seeme a true and a firme knot. And to make it appeare more

hand : and then holding the knot with your forefinger & thombe,
& the nether part of your handkercher with your other fingers,

and lengthen your reines. This doone, turne your handkercher over
the knot with the left hand, in dooing whereof you must suddenlie
slip out the end or corner, putting up the knot of your handkercher
with your forefinger and thombe, as you would put up the foresaid

Boxes to alter one grame into another, or to consuine the graine or
come to notldng.

HERE be divers juggling boxes with false bottoms, wherein
manie false feates are wrought. First they have a box
covered or rather footed alike at each end, the bottome
of the one end being no deeper than as it may conteine
one lane of corne or pepper glewed thereupon. Then use they to put
into the hollow end thereof some other kind of graine, ground or un-
ground ; then doo they cover it, and put it under a hat or candle-
sticke : and either in putting it therinto, or pulling it thence, they
turne the box, and open the contrarie end, wherein is shewed a con-
trarie graine : or else they shew the glewed end first (which end they
suddenlie thrust into a boll or bag of such graine as is glewed alreadie
thereupon) and secondlie the emptie box.

this con-
veiance.

one box into an other.

THere is another box fashioned like a bell, wherinto they doo put
so much, and such corne or spice as the foresaid hollow box can
conteine. Then they stop or cover the same with a peece of lether,
as broad* as a tester, which being thrust up hard towards the midle [*=thick]
part or waste of the said bell, will sticke fast, & beare up the corne.
And if the edge of the leather be wet, it will hold the better. Then
take they the other box dipped (as is aforesaid) in corne, and set downe
the same upon the table, the emptie end upward, saieng that they will
conveie the graine therein into the other box or bell : which being
set downe somewhat hard upon the table, the leather and the corne
therein will fall downe, so as the said bell being taken up from the out it coyer

swept downe with one hand into the other, or into your lap or hat.

Manie feats maie be done with this box, as to put therein a tode,
affirming the same to have beene so turned from corne, &c: and then
manie beholders will; suppose the same to be the jugglers divell,
whereby his feats and miracles are wrought. But in truth, there is
more cunning witchcraft used in transferring of corne after this sort,
than is in the transferring of one mans corne in the grasse into an
other mans feeld : which* the lawe of the twelve tables dooth so
forceablie condemne : for the'one is a cousening slight, the other is a
false lie.

Of an other boxe to convert ivheat into flow er with words, St'c.

THere is an other boxe usuall among jugglers, with a bottome in
the middle thereof, made for the like purposes. One other also
like a tun, wherin is shewed great varietie of stuffe, as well of liquors
as spices, and all by means of an other little tun within the same,
wherein and whereon liquors and spices are shewed. But this would

foorlh at length, betwixt the forefinger and thombe of each hand,
holding all your fingers deintilie, as yong gentlewomen are taught to
take up a morsell of meate. Then let one cut asunder the same thred
in the middle. When that is doone, put the tops of your two thombes
together, and so shall you with lesse suspicion receive the peece of
thred which you hold in your right hand into your left, without opening
of your left finger and thombe : then holding these two peeces as you
did the same before it was cut, let those two be cut also asunder in
the middest, and they conveied againe as before, untill they be cut
verie short, and then roll all those ends together, and keepe that ball
of short threds before the other in your left hand, and with a knife
thrust out the same into a candle, where you may hold it untill the
said ball of short threds be burnt to ashes. Then pull backe the
knife with your right hand, and leave the ashes with the other ball
betwixt the forefinger and thombe of your left hand, and with the two
thombs & two forefingers together seeme to take paines to frot and
rub the ashes, untill your thred be renewed, and drawe out that thred
at length which you kept all this while betwixt your left finger and
thombe. This is not inferior to anie jugglers feateif it be well handled,
for if you have legierdemaine to bestowe the same ball of thred, and to
change it from place to place betwixt your other fingers (as may
easilie be doone) then will it seeme verie strange.

BY a devise not much unlike to this, you may seeme to cut
asunder any lace that hangeth about ones necke, or any point,
girdle, or garter, &c : and with witchcraft or conjuration to
make it whole and closed together againe. For the accomplish-
ment whereof, provide (if you can) a peece of the lace, &c : which
you meane to cut, or at the least a patterne like the same, one
inch and a halfe long, & (keeping it double privilie in your left
hand, betwixt some of your fingers neere to the tips thereof) take the
other lace which you meane to cut, still hanging about ones necke,
and drawe downe your said left hand to the bought thereof: and
putting your owne peece a little before the other (the end or rather
middle whereof you must hide betwixt your forefinger and thombe)
making the eie or bought, which shall be scene, of your owne patterne,
let some stander by cut the same asunder, and it will be surelie
thought that the other lace is cut ; which with words and froting,
&c : you shall seeme to renew & make whole againe. This, if it be
well handled, will seeme miraculous.

The xxxiii. Chapter.

How to make a booke, wherein you shall shew everie leafe therein
to be white, blacke, blew, red, yellow, greene, &^c.

[here are a thousand jugglings, which I am loth to spend
time to describe, whereof some be common, and some
rare, and yet nothing else but deceipt, cousenage, or con-
federacie : whereby you may plainelie see the art to be a
kind of witchcraft. I will end therfore with one devise, which is not
common, but was speciallie used by Clarvis, whome though I never
saw to exercise the feat, yet am I sure I conceive aright of that inven-
tion. He had (they saie) a booke, whereof he would make you thinke
first, that everie leafe was cleane white paper: then by vertue of words
he would shew you everie leafe to be painted with birds, then with
beasts, then with serpents, then with angels, &c : the devise thereof
is this. ^ Make a booke seven inches long, and five inches broad, or
according to that proportion : and let there be xlix, leaves ; to wit,
seven times seven conteined therin, so as you may cut upon the edge
of each leafe six notches, each notch in depth halfe a quarter of an inch,
and one inch distant. Paint everie foureteenth and fifteenth page
(which is the end of everie sixt leafe, & the beginning of everie
seventh) with like colour, or one kind of picture. Cut off with a paire
of sheares everie notch of the first leafe, leaving onlie one inch of
paper in the uppermost place uncut, which will remaine almost halfe a
quarter of an inch higher than anie part of that leafe. Leave an other
like inch in the second place of the second leafe, clipping away one
inch of paper in the highest place immediatlie above it, and all the
notches below the same, and so orderlie to the third, fourth, &c : so
as there shall rest upon each leafe one onlie inch of paper above the
rest. One high uncut inch of paper must answer to the first, direttlie



of Witchcraft. chap. 33. 283

in everie seventh leafe of the booke : so as when you have cut the
first seven leaves, in such sort as I first described, you are to begin in 243.
the selfe same order at the eight leafe, descending in such wise in the
cutting of seven other leaves, and so againe at the fifteenth, to xxi,
&c : untill you have passed through everie leafe, all the thicknes of
your booke.

Now you shall understand, that after the first seven leaves, everie
seventh leafe in the booke is to be painted, saving one seven leaves,
which must remaine white. Howbeit you must observe, that at each
Bumleafe or high inch of paper, seven leaves distant, opposite one
directlie and hneallie against the other, through the thicknesse of the
booke, the same page with the page precedent so to be painted with
the like colour or picture ; and so must you passe through the booke
with seven severall sorts of colours or pictures : so as, when you shall
rest your thombe upon anie of those Bumleaves, or high inches, and
open the booke, you shall see in each page one colour or picture This will
through out the booke ; in an other rowe, an other colour, &c. To io'^the be-
make that matter more plaine unto you, let this be the description holders.
hereof. Hold the booke with your left hand, and (betwixt your fore- 34^.
finger and thombe of your right hand) slip over the booke in what
place you list, and your thombe will alwaies rest at the seventh leafe ;
to wit, at the Bumleafe or high inch of paper from whence when your
booke is streined, it will fall or slip to the next, &c. Which when you
hold fast, & open the booke, the beholders seeing each leafe to have
one colour or picture with so manie varieties, all passing continuallie &
directlie thrugh the whole booke, will suppose that with words you
can discolour the leaves at your pleasure. But because perhaps you wher such
will hardlie conceive herof by this description, you shall (if you be {^""j^o^gn^^
disposed) see or buie for a small value the like booke, at the shop of
W. Brome in Powles churchyard, for your further instruction. ^ There
are certeine feats of activitie, which beautifie this art exceedinglie :
howbeit even in these, some are true, and some are counterfet ; to
wit, some done by practise, and some by confederate. ^ There are
likewise divers feats arythmeticall & geometricall : for them read
Gemma Phrysius, and Record, &^c. which being exercised by jugglers
ad credit to their art. ^ There are also (besides them which I have
set downe in this title of Hartumiin) sundrie strange experiments
reported by Plinie, Albert^ Joh. Bap. Port. Aeap. and Thomas Ltipton^
wherof some are true, and some false : which being knowne to Jannes
dindijainbres, or else to our jugglers, their occupation is the more
magnified, and they thereby more reverenced. ^ Here is place to See more

Desperate or dangerous juggling k7tacks, 7vherein the simple are
made to tliinke, that a seelie juggler ivith words can hurt and
helpe^ kill and revive atiie creature at his pleasure : and first
to kill atiie kind of pull en, and to give it life againe.

AKE a hen, a chicke, or a capon, and thrust a nail or a fine

sharpe pointed knife through the midst of the head

thereof, the edge towards the bill, so as it may seeme

impossible for hir to scape death : then use words, and

pulling out the knife, laie otes before hir, &c : and she will eate and

live, being nothing at all greeved or hurt with the wound ; bicause

the* braine lieth so far behind in the head as it is not touched, though

you thrust your knife betweene the combe and it : and after you have

doone this, you may convert your speach and actions to the greevous

wounding and present recovering of your owne selfe.

To eate a knife, and to fetch it out of anie other place.

TAke a knife, and conteine the same within your two hands,
so as no part be seene thereof but a little of the point, which
you must so bite at the first, as noise may be made therewith.
Then seeme to put a great part thereof into your mouth, and let-
ting your hand slip downe, there will appeare to have beene more
in your mouth than is possible to be conteined therein. Then send
for drinke, or use some other delaie, untill you have let the said
knife slip into your lap, holding both your fists close together as
before, and then raise them so from the edge of the table where
you sit (for from thence the knife may most privilie slip downe
into your lap) and in steed of biting the knife, knable a little upon
your naile, and then seeme to thrust the knife into your mouth,
opening the hand next unto it, and thrust up the other, so as it
may appeare to the standers by, that you have delivered your
24y. hands therof, and thrust it into your mouth : then call for drinke,
after countenance made of pricking and danger, &c. Lastlie, put
your hand into your lap, and taking that knife in your hand, you
may seeme to bring it out from behind you, or from whence you

wine (whereof you may saie you have drunke verie much) runneth
out of your forehead. Then, after countenance of paine and greefe,
pull awaie your hand suddenlie, holding the point downeward ;
and it will fall so out, as it will seeme never to have beene thrust
into the haft : but immediatlie thrust that bodkin into your lap or
pocket, and pull out an other plaine bodkin like the same, saving in
that conceipt.

To thrust a bodkin throtcs;h your toong, and a knife through your
arine : a pittifull sight, without hurt or danger,

MAke a bodkin, the blade therof being sundred in the middle, so
as the one part be not neere to the other almost by three
quarters of an inch, each part being kept a sunder with one small
bought or crooked piece of iron, of the fashion described hereafter in
place convenient. Then thrust your toong betwi.xt the foresaid space ;
to wit, into the bought left it the bodkin blade, thrusting the said
bought behind your teeth, and biting the same : and then shall it
seeme to sticke so fast in and through your toong, as that one can
hardlie pull it out. 1 Also the verie like may be doone with a knife
so made, and put upon your arme : and the wound will appeare the
more terrible, if a little bloud be powred thereupon.

end of the said sticke, from the same eie: and so with the end of the
said sticke, being brought along upon your forhead to the other eie,
you male thrust out the peece of lead, which before you had put

and then shoove it out at the eie : and some put it into both, but the
first is best.

To ctct halfe your nose astmdcr, and to heale it ngaine presentlie

TAke a knife having a round hollow gap in the middle, and laie it
upon your nose, and so shall you seeme to have cut your nose
halfe asunder. Provided alwaies, that in all these you have an other
like knife without a gap, to be shewed upon the pulling out of the
same, and words of inchantment to speake, bloud also to beeraie the
wound, and nimble conveiance.

246. To put a ring through yoicr c he eke,

THere is an other old knacke, which seemeth dangerous to the
cheeke. For the accomplishing whereof you must have two
rings, of like colour and quantitie ; the one filed asunder, so as you
may thrust it upon your cheeke ; the other must be whole, and con-
veied upon a sticke, holding your hand thereupon in the middle of the
sticke, delivering each end of the same sticke to be holden fast by a
stander by. Then conveieng the same cleanlie into your hand, or (for
_34g. lacke of good conveiance) into your lap or pocket, pull awaie your
hand from the sticke : and in pulling it awaie, whirle about the ring,
and so will it be thought that you have put thereon the ring which
was in your cheeke.

To cut off ones head, and to laie it in a platter, &^c : which the
jugglers call the decollation of Johii Baptist,

TO shew a most notable execution by this art, you must cause a
boord, a cloth, and a platter to be purposelie made, and in each
of them holes fit for a boies necke. The boord must be made of two
planks, the longer and broader the better : there must be left within
halfe a yard of the end of each planke halfe a hole ; so as both planks
being thrust togither, there may remaine two holes, like to the holes
in a paire of stocks : there must be made likewise a hole in the table-
cloth or carpet. A platter also must be set directlie over or upon one
of them, having a hole in the midle thereof, of the like quantitie, and
also a peece cut out of the same, so big as his necke, through which
his head may be conveied into the middest of the platter : and then
sitting or kneeling under the boord, let the head onlie remaine upon



of Witchcraft. chap. 34- 287

the boord in the same. Then (to make the sight more dredfull) put
a little brimstone into a chafing dish of coles, setting it before the
head of the boie, who must gaspe two or three times, so as the smoke
enter a little into his nostrils and mouth (which is not unholsome)
and the head presentlie will appeare starke dead ; if the boie set his
countenance accordinglie : and if a little bloud be sprinkled on his
face, the sight will be the stranger.

This is commonlie practised with a boie instructed for that purpose,
who being familiar and conversant with the companie, may be
knowne as well by his face, as by his apparell. In the other end of
the table, where the like hole is made, an other boie of the bignesse
of the knowne boie must be placed, having upon him his usuall
apparell : he must leane or lie upon the boord, and must put his head
under the boord through the said hole, so as his bodie shall seeme to
lie on the one end of the boord, and his head shall lie in a platter on
the other end. ^ There are other things which might be performed obTe^'aTi-^
in this action, the more to astonish the beholders, which because they ""^^"^^^[^"g'.

the place, &c.

To thrust a dagger or bodkin into yotir guts verie strangelie, and
to recover imniediatlie.

AN other miracle may be shewed touching counterfet executions ;
namelie, that with a bodkin or a dagger you shall seeme to kill
your selfe, or at the least make an unrecoverable wound in your bellie :
as (in truth) not long since a juggler caused himself to be killed at a
taverne in cheapside, from whence he presentlie went into Powles Of a jug-
churchyard and died. Which misfortune fell upon him through his iJfungtn
owne foUie, as being then drunken, and having forgotten his plate, the fe^ts^°f
which he should have had for his defense. The devise is this. ^[ You his life.
must prepare a paste boord, to be made according to the fashion of
your bellie and brest : the same must by a painter be coloured cun-
ninglie, not onelie like to your flesh, but with pappes, navill, haire,
&c : so as the same (being handsomelie trussed unto you) may shew
to be your naturall bellie. Then next to your true bellie you may put
a linnen cloth, and thereupon a double plate (which the juggler that
killed himselfe forgot, or wilfullie omitted) over and upon the which
you may place the false bellie. Provided alwaies, that betwixt the
plate & the false bellie you place a gut or bladder of bloud, which

or pinsars ; and the cord, which goeth round about the same, being
drawne to and fro, the beholders will thinke the cord to go through
your nose verie dangerouslie. The knots at the end of the cord,
which doo stale the same from being drawne out of the sticke,
may not be put out at the verie top (for that must be stopped up)
but halfe an inch beneath each end : and so I saie, when it is
pulled, it will seeme to passe through the nose ; and then may you
take a knife, and seeme to cut the cord asunder, and pull the bridle
from your nose.

greatlie advance the power and glorie of God, discovering their pride
and falshood that take upon them to worke miracles, and to be the
mightie power of God, z.s Jatines &ndjatnbres and also Simofi Magus
did.

If anie man doubt of these things, as whether they be not as strange
to behold as I have reported, or thinke with Bodin that these matters
are performed by familiars or divels ; let him go into S. Martins, and
inquire for one John Cautares (a French man by birth, in con-
versation an honest man) and he will shew as much and as strange
actions as these, who getteth not his living hereby, but laboureth
for the same with the sweat of his browes, and neverthelesse hath the
best hand and conveiance (I thinke) of anie man that liveth this daie.
Neither doo I speake (as they saie) without booke herein. For if
time, place, and occasion serve, I can shew so much herein, as I am
sure Bodin, SpitKrus, and Vainis, would sweare I were a witch, and
had a familiar divell at commandement. But truelie my studie and
travell herein hath onelie beene emploied to the end I might proove
them fooles, and find out the fraud of them that make them fooles, as
whereby they may become wiser, and God may have that which to
him belongeth.

And bicause the maner of these juggling conveiances are not easilie
conceived by discourse of words ; I have caused to be set downe
diverse formes of instruments used in this art ; which may serve for
patternes to them that would throughlie see the secrets thereof, and
make them for their owne private practises, to trie the event of such
devises, as in this tract of legierdemaine are shewed. Where note,
that you shall find everie instrument that is most necessarilie
occupied in the working of these strange feats, to beare the just and
true number of the page, where the use thereof is in ample words
declared.

Now will I proceed with another cousening point of witchcraft, apt
for the place, necessarie for the time, and in mine opinion meet to be
discovered, or at the least to be defaced among deceitful! arts. And
bicause manie are abused heereby to their utter undooing, for
that it hath had passage under the protection of learn-
ing, wherby they pretend to accomplish their
works, it hath gone freelie with-
out generall controlment
through all ages,
nations &

The first Chapter.

Of the art of A Icumystrie, of their woords of art and devises to
blear e mens eies, and to proctire credit to their profession.

I ERE I thought it not impertinent to saie somewhat of the
art or rather the craft of Alcumystrie, otherwise called
Multiplication ; which Chaticer, of all other men, most
livelie deciphereth. In the bowels herof dooth both
witchcraft and conjuration lie hidden, as whereby some cousen others,
and some are cousened themselves. For by this mysterie (as it is
said in the chanons mans prolog)

They take upon them to turnc upside downe,

All the earth betwixt Southwarke &^ Canturburie towne,

And to pave it all of silver and gold, &^c.

But ever they lacke of their conclusion^

And to imich folke they doo illusion.

For their stuffe slides awaie so fast,

That it makes them beggers at the last,

A 7id by this craft they doo never win,

But make their pursse emptie, and their wits thin.

And bicause the practisers heereof would be thought wise, learned,
cunning, and their crafts maisters, they have devised words of art,
sentences and epithets obscure, and confectious* so innumerable
(which are also compounded of strange and rare simples) as confound
the capacities of them that are either set on worke heerein, or be
brought to behold or expect their conclusions. For what plaine man
would not beleeve, that they are learned and jollie fellowes, that have
in such readinesse so many mysticall termes of art : as (for a tast)
their subliming, amalgaming, engluting,* imbibing, incorporating,
cementing, ritrination, terminations, mollifications, and indurations
of bodies, matters combust and coagulat, ingots, tests, &c. Or who
is able to conceive (by reason of the abrupt confusion, contranetie,
and multitude of drugs, simples, and confections) the operation and
mysterie of their stuffe and workemanship. For these things and

subtill fiers, some of wood, some of cole, composed speciallie of
beech, &c. And bicause they will not seeme to want anie point of
cousenage to astonish the simple, or to moove admiration to their
enterprises, they have (as they affirme) foure spirits to worke withall,
whereof the first is, orpiment ; the second, quicksilver ; the third,
sal armoniake ; the fourth, brimstone. Then have they seven celes-
tiall bodies ; namelie. So, Luna, Mars, Merctirie, Satitriie, Jupiter^
and Ventis ; to whome they applie seven terrestriall bodies ; to wit,
gold, silver, iron, quickesilver, lead, tinne, and copper, attributing
unto these the operation of the other ; speciallie if the terrestriall
bodies be qualified, tempered, and wrought in the houre and daie
according to the feats* of the celestiall bodies: with more like [»? seats]

The second Chapter. jj-jr.

The Alaanysters drift, the Chanons yeoinans tale, of alcuniysticall
stones and waters.

jOW you must understand that the end and drift of all
their worke, is, to atteine unto the composition of the
philosophers stone, called Alixer, and to the stone called
Titanus ; and to Magnatia, which is a water made of the
foure elements, which (they saie) the philosophers are sworne neither
to discover, nor to write of. And by these they mortifie quicke silver,
and make it malleable, and to hold touch : heereby also they convert
any other mettall (but speciallie copper) into gold. This science
(forsooth) is the secret of secrets ; even as Salomons conjuration is
said among the conjurors to be so likewise. And thus, when they
chance to meete with yong men, or simple people, they boast and

brag, and saie with Simon Magus, that they can worke miracles, and
bring mightie things to passe. In which respect Chaucer truehe
heereof saith :

Each 7nan is as 7vise as Sahtnon,

When they are togither everichone :

But he that seones wisest, is mostfoole in preefe,

And he that is truest, is a verie theefe.

They seevie friendlie to them that knoive nought,

But they are feeiidlie both in luord ajid tJwught,

Yet jnany men ride and seeke their acquaintance.

Not knowing of their false gotiernance.l

He also saith, and experience verifieth his assertion, that they
looke ill favouredlie, & are alwaies beggerlie attired : his words are
these :

TJiese fellowes looke ill favotiredlie^

And are ahuaies tired beggerlie,\

So as by smelling and thredbare araie,

These folke are knowne and discerned alwaie.

But so long as they have a sheet to wrap them in by night,

Or a rag to hang about them in the day light,

They will it spend in this craft.

They cannot stint till nothi7ig be laft.

Here one may learne if lie have ought.

To multiplie aud britig his good to naught.

But if a man aske them privilie,

Whie they are clothed so unthriftilie.

They will round him in the eare and saie,

If they espied were, men would them slaie,

A nd all bicause of this noble science :

Lo thus these folke beetraien innocence.

The tale of the chanons yeoman published by Chaucer, dooth
make (by waie of example) a perfect demonstration of the art of
Alcumystrie or multiplication : the effect whereof is this. A chanon
being an Alcumyster or cousenor, espied a covetous preest, whose
pursse he knew to be well lined, whome he assaulted with flatterie
and subtill speach, two principall points belonging to this art. At
the length he borrowed monie of the preest, which is the third part
of the art, without the which the professors can doo no good, nor
indure in good estate. Then he at his daie repaied the monie, which
is the most difficult point in this art, and a rare experiment. Finallie,
to i-equite the preests courtesie, he promised unto him such instruc-



of WitcJicraft. chap. 3. 297

tions, as wherby with expedition he should become infinitelie rich,
and all through this art of multiplication. And this is the most
common point in this science ; for herein they must be skilfull
before they can be famous, or atteine to anie credit. The preest
disliked not his proffer ; speciallie bicause it tended to his profit,
and embraced his courtesie. Then the chanon willed him foorthwith
to send for three ownces of quicke silver, which he said he would
transubstantiate (by his art) into perfect silver. The preest thought
that a man of his profession could not dissemble, and therefore with
great joy and hope accomplished his request.

And now (forsooth) goeth this jollie Alcumyst about his busines 337.
and worke of multiplication, and causeth the preest to make a fier of
coles, in the bottome whereof he placeth a croslet ; and pretending
onelie to helpe the preest to laie the coles handsomelie, he foisteth
into the middle ward or lane of coles, a beechen cole, within the
which was conveied an ingot of perfect silver, which (when the cole
was consumed) slipt downe into the croslet, that was (I saie) directlie
under it. The preest perceived not the fraud, but received the ingot j^y^ts^taU
of silver, and was not a little joyfull to see such certeine successe to catch a 252.
proceed from his owne handle worke wherein could be no fraud (as
he surelie conceived) and therefore verie willinglie gave the cannon
fortie pounds for the receipt of this experiment, who for that summe
of monie taught him a lesson in Alcumystrie, but he never returned
to heare repetitions, or to see how he profited.



The third Chapter.

Of a ycomati of the countrie coiisciied by an Alcnniyst.






COULD cite manie Alcumysticall cousenages wrought by
Doctor Burcot, Feates, and such other ; but I will passe
them over, and onelie repeate three experiments of that
art ; the one practised upon an honest yeoman in the
countie of Kent, the other upon a mightie prince, the third upon a
covetous preest. And first touching the yeoman, he was overtaken
and used in maner and forme following, by a notable cousening
varlot, who professed Alcumystrie, juggling, witchcraft, and conjura-
tion : and by meanes of his companions and confederats discussed
the simplicitie and abilitie of the said yeoman, and found out his
estate and humor to be convenient for his purpose ; and finallie
came a wooing (as they saie) to his daughter, to whome he made

love cunninglie in words, though his purpose tended to another
matter. And among other illusions and tales, concerning his owne
commendation, for welth, parentage, inheritance, alliance, activitie,
learning, pregnancie, and cunning, he boasted of his knowledge and
experience in Alcumystrie ; making the simple man beleeve that he
could multiplie, and of one angell make two or three. Which seemed
strange to the poore man, in so much as he became willing enough
to see that conclusion : whereby the Alcumyster had more hope and
comfort to atteine his desire, than if his daughter had yeelded to have
maried him. To be short, he in the presence of the said yeoman,
did include within a little ball of virgine wax, a couple of angels ;
and after certeine ceremonies and conjuring words he seemed to
deliver the same unto him : but in truth (through legierdemaine) he
conveied into the yeomans hand another ball of the same scantling,
wherein were inclosedmanie more angels than were in the ball which
he thought he had received. Now (forsooth) the Alcumyster bad
him laie up the same ball of wax, and also use certeine ceremonies
(which I thought good heere to omit). And after certeine daies,
houres, and minuts they returned together, according to the appoint-
ment, and found great gaines by the multiplication of the angels.
Insomuch as he, being a plaine man, was heereby persuaded, that he
should not onelie have a rare and notable good sonne in lawe ; but
a companion that might helpe to adde unto his welth much treasure,
and to his estate great fortune and felicitie. And to increase this
opinion in him, as also to winne his further favour ; but speciallie to
bring his cunning Alcumystrie, or rather his lewd purpose to passe ;
he told him that it were follie to multiplie a pound of gold, when as
easilie they might multiplie a millian : and therefore counselled him
to produce all the monie he had, or could borrowe of his neighbours
and freends ; and did put him out of doubt, that he would multiplie
the same, and redouble it exceedinglie, even as he savve by experience
how he delt with the small summe before his face. This yeoman, in
hope of gaines and preferment, &c : consented to this sweete motion,
and brought out and laid before his feete, not the one halfe of his
goods, but all that he had, or could make or borrowe anie maner of
waie. Then this juggling Alcumyster, having obteined his purpose,
folded the same in a ball, in quantitie farre bigger than the other, and
conveieng the same into his bosome or pocket, delivered another
ball (as before) of the like cjuantitie unto the yeoman, to be reserved
and safelie kept in his chest ; whereof (bicause the matter was of
importance) either of them must have a key, and a severall locke,
that no interruption might be made to the ceremonie, nor abuse by
either of them, in defrauding ech other. Now (forsooth) these cir-

cumstances and ceremonies being ended, and the Alcumysters
purpose therby performed ; he told the yeoman that (untill a certeine
daie and houre limitted to returne) either of them might emploie
themselves about their busines, and necessarie affaires ; the yeoman
to the plough, and he to the citie of Loiidoti, and in the meane time
the gold shuld multiplie, &c. But the Alcumyster (belike) having other
matters of more importance came not just at the houre appointed,
nor yet at the daie, nor within the yeare : so as, although it were
somewhat against the yeomans conscience to violate his promise, or
breake the league ; yet partlie by the longing he had to see, and
partlie the desire he had to enjoie the fruit of that excellent experi-
ment, having (for his owne securitie) and the others satisfaction, some
testimonie at the opening thereof, to witnesse his sincere dealing, he
brake up the coffer, and lo he soone espied the ball of wax, which he
himselfe had laid up there with his owne hand. So as he thought
(if the hardest should fall) he should find his principal! : and whie
not as good increase hereof now, as of the other before. But alas !
when the wax was broken, and the metall discovered, the gold was
much abased, and beecame perfect lead.

prest, assuring the king and his councell, that he would shortlie
returne, and accomplish his promise, &;c. Soone after, the kings
foole, among other jestes, fell into a discourse and discoverie of fooles,
and handled that common place so pleasantlie, that the king began
to take delight therein, & to like his merrie veine. Whereupon he
would needes have the foole deliver unto him a schedull or scroll,
conteining the names of all the most excellent fooles in the land.

So he caused the kings name to be first set downe, and next him
all the names of the lords of his privie councell. The king seeing
him so sawcie and malepert, ment to have had him punished : but
some of his councell, knowing him to be a fellow pleasantlie con-
ceipted, besought his majestie rather to demand of him a reason of
his libell, &c : than to proceed in extremitie against him. Then the
foole being asked why he so sawcilie accused the king and his
councell of principall follie, answered ; Bicause he sawe one foolish
knave beguile them all, and to cousen them of so great a masse of
monie, and finallie to be gone out of their reach. Why (said one of
the councell) he male returne and performe his promise, &c. Then

king) canst thou doo that ? Marie sir (said he) then I will blotte out

Alcumystrie. Which thing another cousening preest perceived, and

dealt with him in maner and forme following.

■ M. Doctor Balbine (said he) I being a stranger unto you male A flattering

alwaies are busied in great and divine studies. To whome Balbine,
being a man of few words, gave a nodde : which was more than he
used to everie man. But the preest knowing his humor, said ; I am
sure sir, if you knew my sute, you would pardon mine importunitie.
I praie thee good sir John (said Balbine) shew me thy mind, and be
breefe. That shall I doo sir (said he) with a good will. You know
M. Doctor, through your skill in philosophie, that everie mans destinie
is not alike ; and I for my part am at this point, that I cannot tell
whether I male be counted happie or infortunate. For when I weigh
mine owne case, or rather my state, in part I seeme fortunate, and in
part miserable. But Balbine being a man of some surlinesse, alwaies
willed him to draw his matter to a more compendious forme : which
thing the preest said he would doo, and could the better performe ; j62.
bicause Balbine himselfe was so learned and expert in the verie mat-
ter he had to repeat, and thus he began.

I have had, even from my childhood, a great felicitie in the art of
Alcumystrie, which is the verie marrow of all philosophie. Balbine
at the naming of the word Alcumystrie, inclined and yeelded himselfe
more attentivelie to hearken unto him : marie it was onelie in gesture
of bodie ; for he was spare of speech, and yet he bad him proceed
with his tale. Then said the preest. Wretch that I am, it was not my
lucke to light on the best waie : for you M. Balbine know (being so
universallie learned) that in this art there are two waies, the one Longation
called longation, the other curtation ; and it was mine ill hap to fall ^."<^ '^."'^'fj
upon longation. When Balbine asked him the difference of those cumystrie.
two waies ; Oh sir said the preest, you might count me impudent, to
take upon me to tell you, that of all other are best learned in this art,
to whome I come, most humblie to beseech you to teach me that
luckie waie of curtation. The cunninger you are, the more easilie
you maie teach it me : and therefore hide not the gift that God hath
given you, from your brother, who maie perish for want of his desire
in this behalfe ; and doubtlesse Jesus Christ will inrich you with
greater blessings and endowments.

Balbifte being abashed partlie with his importunitie, and partlie
with the strange circumstance, told him that (in truth) he neither
knew what longation or curtation meant ; and therefore required him
to expound the nature of those words. Well (quoth the preest) since
it is your pleasure, I will doo it, though I shall thereby take upon me
to teach him that is indeed much cunninger than my selfe. And thus he

began : Oh sir, they that have spent all the daies of their life in this
divine facultie, doo turne one nature and forme into another, two waies,
the one is verie breefe, but somewhat dangerous ; the other much lon-
ger, mane verie safe, sure, and commodious. Howbeit, I thinke my
selfe most unhappie that have spent my time and travell in that
waie which utterlie misliketh me, and never could get one to shew
me the other that I so earnestlie desire. And now I come to your
worship, whom I know to be wholie learned and expert herein,
hoping that you will (for charities sake) comfort your brother,
whose felicitie and well doing now resteth onelie in your hands ; and
therefore I beseech you releeve me with your counsell.

By these and such other words when this cousening varlot had
avoided suspicion of guile, and assured Balbine that he was perfect
and cunning in the other waie : Balbme his fingers itched, and his
hart tickled ; so as he could hold no longer, but burst out with
these words : Let this curtation go to the divell, whose name I did
never so much as once heare of before, and therefore doo much lesse
understand it. But tell me in good faith, doo you exactlie under-
stand longation } Yea said the preest, doubt you not hereof : but I
have no fansie to that waie, it is so tedious. Why (quoth Balbme)
what time is required in the accomplishment of this worke by waie of
longation ? Too too much said the Alcumyster, even almost a whole
yeere : but this is the best, the surest, and the safest waie, though it be
for so manie moneths prolonged, before it yeeld advantage for cost and
charges expended thereabouts. Set your hart at rest (said Balbine) it
is no matter, though it were two yeeres, so as you be well assured to
bring it then to passe.

Finallie, it was there and then concluded, that presentlie the preest
should go in hand with the worke, and the other should beare the
charge, the gaines to be indififerentlie divided betwixt them both, and
the worke to be doone privilie in Balbins house. And after the
mutuall oth was taken for silence, which is usuall and requisite alwaies
in the beginning of this mysterie ; Balbine delivered monie to the Al-
cumyster for bellowes, glasses, coles, &c : which should serve for the
erection and furniture of the forge. Which monie the Alcumyster
had no sooner fingered, but he ran merilie to the dice, to the alehouse,
& to the stewes, and who there so lustie as cousening s\r Jout : who
indeed this waie made a kindof alcumysticall transformation of monie.
Now Balbine urged him to go about his businesse, but the other told
him, that if the matter were once begun, it were halfe ended : for
therein consisted the greatest difificultie.

Well, at length he began to furnish the fornace, but now forsooth a
new supplie of gold must be made, as the seed and spawne of that

which must be ingendred and grow out of this worke of Alcumystrie.
For even as a fish is not caught without a bait, no more is gold mul-
tiplied without some parcels of gold : and therfore gold must be the
foundation and groundworke of that art, or else all the fat is in the
fier. But all this while Balbine was occupied in calculating, and
musing upon his accompt ; casting by arythmetike, how that if one
ownce yeelded fifteene, then how much gaines two thousand ownces
might yeeld : for so much he determined to emploie that waie.

When the Alcumyst had also consumed this monie, shewing great
travell a moneth or twaine, in placing the bellowes, the coles, and
such other stuffe, and no whit of profit proceeding or comming there-
of : Balbine demanded how the world went, our Alcumyst was as a
man amazed. Howbeit he said at length ; Forsooth even as such
matters of importance commonlie doo go forward, wherunto there is
alvvaies verie difficult accesse. There was (saith he) a fault (which I
have now found out) in the choice of the coles, which were of oke,
and should have beene of beech. One hundreth duckets were spent
that waie, so as the dising house and the stewes were partakers of
Balbines charges. But after a new supplie of monie, better coles were
provided, and matters more circumspectlie handled. Howbeit, when
the forge had travelled long, and brought foorth nothing, there was
another excuse found out ; to wit, that the glasses were not tempered
as they ought to have beene. But the more monie was disbursed here-
abouts, the woorsse willing was Balbine to give over, according to
the disers veine, whome frutelesse hope bringeth into a fooles
paradise.

The Alcumyst, to cast a good colour upon his knaverie, tooke on
like a man moonesicke, and protested with great words full of forgerie
and lies, that he never had such lucke before. But having found the
error, he would be sure enough never hereafter to fall into the like
oversight, and that henceforward all should be safe and sure, and
throughlie recompensed in the end with large increase. Hereupon
the workehouse is now the third time repaired, and a new supplie yet
once againe put into the Alcumysts hand ; so as the glasses were
changed. And now at length the Alcumyst uttered another point of
his art and cunning to Balbine \ to wit, that those matters would pro- Notable
ceed much better, if he sent our Ladie a few French crownes in ^ousenaj
reward : for the art being holie, the matter cannot prosperously ^()^.
proceed, without the favour of the saints. Which counsell exceedinglie
pleased Balbine, who was so devout and religious, that no dale escaped
him but he said our Ladie mattens.

Now our Alcumyster having received the offering of monie, goeth
on his holie pilgrimage, even to the next village, & there consumeth

it everie penie, among bawds and knaves. And at his returne, he told
Balbine that he had great hope of good lucke in his businesse ; the
holie virgine gave such favourable countenance, and such attentive
eare unto his praiers and vowes. But after this, when there had
beene great travell bestowed, and not a dram of gold yeelded nor
levied from the forge ; Balbine began to expostulate and reason some-
what roundlie with the cousening fellowe ; who still said he never had
such filthie lucke in all his life before, and could not devise by what
meanes it came to passe, that things went so overthwartlie. But after
much debating betwixt them upon the matter, at length it came into
Balbines head to aske him if he had not foreslowed to heare masse,
or to saie his houres : which if he had doone, nothing could prosper
under his hand. Without doubt (said the cousener) you have hot the
naile on the head. Wretch that I am ! I remember once or twise
being at a long feast, I omitted to saie mine Ave Marie after dinner.
So so (said Balbine^ no marvell then that a matter of such importance
hath had so evill successe. The Alcumyster promised to doo
penance ; as to heare twelve masses for two that he had fore-
slowed ; and for everie Ave overslipped, to render and repeate twelve
to our Ladie.

Soone after this, when allour Alcumysters monie was spent, &also
258. his shifts failed how to come by any more, he came home with this
devise, as a man woonderfullie fraied and amazed, pitiouslie crieng and
lamenting his misfortune. Whereat Balbine being astonished, desired
to knowe the cause of his complaint. Oh (said the Alcumyster) the
courtiers have spied our enterprise ; so as I for my part looke for
nothing but present imprisonment. Whereat Balbine was abashed,
bicause it was flat fellonie to go about that matter, without speciall
licence. But (quoth the Alcumyster) I feare not to be put to death, I
would it would fall out so : marrie I feare least I shall be shut up
j66. in some castell or towre, and there shall be forced to tug about this
worke and broile in this businesse all the dales of my life.

Now the matter being brought to consultation, Balbine, bicause he
was cunning in the art of rhetorike, and not altogither ignorant in
lawe, beat his braines in devising how the accusation might be
answered, and the danger avoided. Alas (said the Alcumyster) you
trouble your selfe all in vaine, for you see the crime is not to be denied,
it is so generallie bruted in court : neither can the fact be defended,
bicause of the manifest lawe published against it. To be short, when
manie waies were devised, and divers excuses alledged by Balbine,
and no sure ground to stand on for their securitie ; at length the
Alcumyster having present want and need of monie, framed his speech
in this sort ; Sir said he to Balbine, we use slowe counsell, and yet

the matter requireth hast. For I thinke they are comming for me
yer this time to hale me awaie to prison ; and I see no remedie
but to die vahantHe in the cause. In good faith (said Balbine) I
knowe not what to saie to the matter. No more do I said the
Alcumyster, but that I see these courtiers are hungrie for monie,
and so much the readier to be corrupted & framed to silence. And
though it be a hard matter, to give those rakehels till they be
satisfied : yet I see no better counsell or advise at this time. No
more could Balbine^ who gave him thirtie ducats of gold to stop
their mouthes, who in an honest cause would rather have given so
manie teeth out of his head, than one of those peeces out of his
pouch. This coine had the Alcumyster, who for all his pretenses
& gaie gloses was in no danger, other than for lacke of monie
to leese his leman or concubine, whose acquaintance he would not
give over, nor forbeare hir companie, for all the goods that he
was able to get, were it by never such indirect dealing and unlawful!
meanes.

Well, yet now once againe dooth Balbine newlie furnish the forge,
a praier being made before to our Ladie to blesse the enterprise. And
all things being provided and made I'eadie according to the Alcumys-
ters owne asking, & all necessaries largelie ministred after his owne
liking ; a whole yeare being likewise now consumed about this boot-
lesse businesse, and nothing brought to passe ; there fell out a
strange chance, and tha.c by this meanes insuing, as you shall heare.

Our Alcumyster forsooth used a little extraordinarie lewd c5panie
with a courtiers wife, whiles he was from home, who suspecting the
matter, came to the doore unlooked for, and called to come in,
threatning them that he would breake open the doores upon them.
Some present devise (you see) was now requisite, and there was
none other to be had, but such as the oportunitie offered ; to wit, to
leape out at a backe window : which he did, not without great hazard,
and some hurt. But this was soone blazed abroad, so as it came to
Balbincs eare, who shewed in countenance that he had heard heereof,
though he said nothing. But the Alcumyster knew him to be devout,
& somewhat superstitious : and such men are easie to be intreated
to forgive, how great soever the fault be, and devised to open the
matter in maner and forme following.

O Lord (saith he before Balbine) how infortunatlie goeth our
businesse forward ! I marvell what should be the cause. Whereat
Balbine, being one otherwise that seemed to have vowed silence,
tooke occasion to speake, saieng; It is not hard to knowe the impedi-
ment and stop heereof: for it is sinne that hindcreth this matter;
which is not to be dealt in but with pure hands. Whereat the Alcumys-

ter fell upon his knees, beating his breast, & lamentablie cried, saieng ;
Oh maister Balbine, you saie most trulie, it is sinne that hath doone
us all this displeasure ; not your sinne sir, but mine owne, good maister
Balbine. Neither will I be ashamed to discover my filthinesse unto
you, as unto a most holy and ghostlie father. The infirmitie of the
flesh had overcome me, and the divell had caught me in his snare.
Oh wretch that I am ! Of a preest I am become an adulterer.
Howbeit, the monie that erstwhile was sent to our Ladie, was not
utterlie lost : for if she had not beene, I had certeinlie beene slaine.
For the good man of the house brake open the doore, and the win-
dowe was lesse than I could get out thereat. And in that extremitie
of danger it came into my mind to fall downe prostrate to the virgine;
beseeching hir (if our gift were acceptable in hir sight) that she
Avould, in consideration thereof, assist me with hir helpe. And to be
short, I ran to the windowe, and found it bigge enough to leape out
at. Which thing Balbijie did not onelie beleeve to be true, but in
respect therof forgave him, religiouslie admonishing him to shew
himselfe thankfull to that pitiful! and blessed Ladie.

Now once againe more is made a new supplie of monie, and
mutuall promise made to handle this divine matter hence forward
purelie and holilie. To be short, after a great number of such parts
plaied by the Alcumyster ; one of Balbins acquaintance espied him,
that knew him from his childhood to be but a cousening merchant;
and told Balbine what he was, and that he would handle him in the
end, even as he had used manie others : for a knave he ever was, and
so he would proove. But what did Balbine, thinke you ? Did he com-
plaine of this counterfet, or cause him to be punished? No, but he
gave him monie in his pursse, and sent him awaie ; desiring him, of
all courtesie, not to blab abroad how he had cousened him. And as
for the knave Alcumyster, he needed not care who knew it, or what
came of it : for he had nothing in goods or fame to be lost. And as
for his cunning in Alcumystrie, he had as much as an asse. By this
discourse Erasmus would give us to note, that under the golden name
of Alcumystrie there lieth lurking no small calamitie ; wherein there
be such severall shifts and sutes of rare subtilties and deceipts, as
that not onelie welthie men are thereby manie times impoverished,
and that with the sweete allurement of this art, through their owne
covetousnesse ; as also by the flattering baits of hoped gaine : but
even wise and learned men hereby are shamefullie overshot, partlie
for want of due experience in the wiles and subtilties of the world,
and partlie through the softenesse and pliablenesse of their good
nature, which cousening knaves doo commonlie abuse to their owne
lust and commoditie, and to the others utter undooing.

answereth him ; It is a woonder from whence that hope should

manie rich men, by this vanitie and madnes have beene brought to

runne awaie with thy gold, and thou never the wiser, saith Petrarch.
He promiseth mee great good, saith the disciple. He will first serve
his owne turne, and releeve his private povertie, saith Petrarch ; for
Alcumysters are a beggerlie kind of people, who though they con-
fesse themselves bare and needie, yet will they make others rich and
welthie : as though others povertie did more molest and pitie them
than their owne. These be the words of Petrarch, a man of great
learning and no lesse experience ; who as in his time he sawe the
fraudulent fetches of this compassing craft : so hath there beene no
age, since the same hath beene broched, wherein some few wisemen
have not smelt out the evill meaning of these shifting merchants,
and bewraied them to the world.

261. 370. and setteth them as deepe in the degree of theeves, as anie of the
rest, whose injurious dealings are brought'to open arreignment. It
is demanded (saith he) why the art of Alcumystrie doth never proove
that in effect, which it pretendeth in precept and promise. The
answer is readie ; that if by art gold might be made, then were it
behoovefull to know the maner and proceeding of nature in genera-
tion ; sith art is said to imitate and counterfet nature. Againe, it is
bicause of the lamenesse and unperfectnesse of philosophie, speciallie
concerning minerals: no such manner of proceeding being set downe
by consent and agreement of philosophers in writing, touching the
true and undoubted effect of the same. Where upon one suppos-
eth that gold is made of one kind of stuffe this waie, others of
another kind of stuffe that waie. And therefore it is a chance if anie
atteine to the artificiall applieng of the actives and passives of gold
and silver. Moreover, it is certeine, that quicke silver and sulphur
are the materials (as they terme them) of mettals, and the agent is
heate, which directeth : howbeit it is verie hard to know the due pro-
portion of the mixture of the materials ; which proportion the genera-
tion of gold doth require. And admit that by chance they atteine to
such proportion ; yet can they not readilie resume or doo it againe in
another worke, bicause of the hidden diversities of materials, and
the uncerteintie of applieng the actives and passives.

The same ancient author concluding against this vaine art, saith,
that of all christian lawmakers it is forbidden, and in no case toUerable
in anie commonwelth : first bicause it presumeth to forge idols for
covetousnes, which are gold and silver ; whereupon saith the
apostle, Covetousenesse is idolworship : secondlie, for that (as
Aristotle saith) coine should be skant and rare, that it might be
deere ; but the same would waxe vile, and of small estimation, if by
the art of Alcumystrie gold and silver might be multiplied : thirdlie,
bicause (as experience prooveth) wisemen are thereby bewitched,
couseners increased, princes abused, the rich impoverished, the
poore beggered, the multitude made fooles, and yet the craft and
craftesmaisters (oh madnes !) credited. Thus far he. Whereby in
few words he discountenanceth that profession, not by the imagina-
tions of his owne braine, but by manifold circumstances of mani-
jyi. fest proofe. Touching the which practise 1 thinke inough hath
beene spoken, and more a great deale than needed ; sith so
plaine and demonstrable a matter requireth the lesse travell in con-
futation.

That vaine and deceitnil hope is a great cause why men are

bootelesse, Ss^c.

j ITHERTO somewhat at large I have detected theknaverie
of the art Alcumysticall, partlie by reasons, and partlie by
examples : so that the thing it selfe maie no lesse appeare
to the judiciall eie of the considerers ; than the bones 262.

No mervell then though Alcumystrie allure men so sweetlie, and

A continiiatio7i of the former matter, with a cotichisioti of the
same.

HAT which I have declared before, by reasons, examples,
and authorities, I will now prosecute and conclude by
one other example ; to the end that we, as others in
former ages, male judge of vaine hope accordinglie, and
be no lesse circumspect to avoid the inconveniences therof, than
Ulysses was warie to escape the incantations of Circes that old trans-
forming witch. Which example of mine is drawne from Lewes the
French king, the eleventh of that name, who being on a time at
Burgundie, fell acquainted by occasion of hunting with one Cotiojt, a
clownish but yet an honest and hartie good fellow. For princes and
great men delight much in such plaine clubhutchens. The king
oftentimes, by meanes of his game, used the countrimans house for
his refreshing ; and as noble men sometimes take pleasure in homelie
and course things, so the king did not refuse to eate turnips and rape
rootes in Conons cotage. Shortlie after king Lewes being at his
pallace, void of troubles and disquietnesse, Conons wife wild him to
repaire to the court, to shew himselfe to the king, to put him in mind
of the old intertainement which he had at his house, and to present
him with some of the fairest and choisest rape rootes that she had in
store. Conon seemed loth, alledging that he should but lose his
labour : for princes (saith he) have other matters in hand, than to
intend to thinke of such trifeling courtesies. But Conons wife over-
came him, and persuaded him in the end, choosing a certeine number
of the best and goodliest rape rootes that she had ; which when she
had given hir husband to carrie to the court, he set forward on his
journie a good trudging pase. But Conon being tempted by the waie,
partlie with desire of eating, and partlie with the toothsomnes of the
meate which he bare, that by little and little he devoured up all the
roots saving one, which was a verie faire and a goodlie great one
indeed. Now when Conon was come to the court, it was his lucke to
stand in such a place, as the king passing by, and spieng the man,
did well remember him, and commanded that he should be brought
in. Conon verie cheerelie followed his guide hard at the heeles, and
no sooner sawe the king, but bluntlie comming to him, reached out

his hand, and presented the gift to his maiestie. The king received
it with more cheerefulnes than it was offered, and bad one of those
that stood next him, to take it, and laie it up among those things which
he esteemed most, & had in greatest accompt. Then he had Cotton
to dine with him, and after dinner gave the countriman great thanks
for his rape roote ; who made no bones of the matter, but boldhe made
challenge and claime to the kings promised courtesie. Whereupon
the king commanded, that a thousand crownes should be given him A princeiie

, , . largesse.

m recompense for his roote.

The report of this bountifulnes was spred in short space over all
the kings houshold : in so much as one of his courtiers, in hope of
the like or a larger reward gave the king a verie proper ginnet.
Whose drift the king perceiving, and judging that his former liberalitie
to the clowne, provoked the courtier to this covetous attempt, tooke
the ginnet verie thankefullie : and calling some of his noble men
about him, began to consult with them, what mends he might make
his servant for his horsse. Whiles this was a dooing, the courtier
conceived passing good hope of some princeiie largesse, calculating j>^^.
and casting his cards in this maner ; If his maiestie rewarded a
sillie clowne so bountifullie for a simple rape roote, what will he doo
to a joUie courtier for a gallent gennet ? Whiles the king was de-
bating the matter, and one said this, another that, and the courtier
travelled all the while in vaine hope, at last saith the king, even upon
the sudden ; I have now bethought me what to bestowe upon him :
and calling one of his nobles to him, whispered him in the eare, and
willed him to fetch a thing, which he should find in his chamber
wrapped up in silke. The roote is brought wrapped in silke, which sicarsdelu-
the king with his owne hands gave to the courtier, using these words <^^''' '^''i^-
therewithall, that he sped well, in so much as it was his good hap to
have for his horsse a Jewell that cost him a thousand crownes. The
courtier was a glad man, and at his departing longed to be looking
what it was, and his hart dansed for joy. In due time therefore he
unwrapped the silke (a sort of his fellow courtiers flocking about him
to testifie his good lucke) and having unfolded it, he found therein a
drie and withered rape roote. Which spectacle though it set the
standers about in a lowd laughtei", yet it quailed the courtiers courage,
and cast him into a shrewd fit of pensifenes. Thus was the con-
fidence of this courtier turned to vanitie, who upon hope of good speed
was willing to part from his horsse for had I wist.

This storie dooth teach us into what follie and madnes vaine hope The mo-
may drive undiscreete and unexpert men. And therefore no mervell p^iemisses.
though Alcumysters dreame and dote after double advantage, faring

shadowe of the flesh which he carried in his mouth over the water,
lost both the one and the other : as they doo their increase and their
principall. But to breake off abruptlie from this matter, and to leave
these hypocrits (for whie may they not be so named, who as Homer,
speaking in detestation of such rakehelles, saith verie divinelie and
trulie ;

Odz etenini seu claiistra Ercbi, quia'tnqne loqineniur

Those that one thing with toong doo tell,

To leave these hypocrits (I saie) in the dregs of their dishonestie,
I will conclude against them peremptorilie, that they, with the rable
above rehearsed, and the rowt hereafter to be mentioned, are ranke
couseners, and consuming cankers to the common wealth, and there-
fore to be rejected and excommunicated from the fellowship of all
honest men. For now their art, which turneth all kind of metals that
they can come by into mist and smoke, is no lesse apparent to the

The exposition of lidoni, and where it is found, whereby the whole
art of conjnratio7i is deciphered.

|HIS word lidoni is derived of lada, which properlie signi-
fieth to knowe : it is sometimes translated, *Divimcs, which [* ltai.\
is a divinor or soothsaier, as in Dent. i8. Levit. 20 : some-
^J VwVits^Ariohis., which is one that also taketh upon him to
foretell things to come, and is found Levit. 19. 2. Kings. 23. Esai. 19.
To be short, the opinion of them that are most skilfull in the toongs, The large
is, that it comprehendeth all them, which take upon them to knowe onoVtiie'
all things past and to come, and to give answers accordinglie. It j'"""? ^'"
alwaies followeth the word *0b, and m the scriptures is not named
severallie from it, and dififereth little from the same in sense, and
doo both concerne oracles uttered by spirits, possessed people, or
couseners. What will not couseners or witches take upon them to
doo ? Wherein will they professe ignorance ? Aske them anie
cjuestion, they will undertake to resolve you, even of that which
none but God knoweth. And to bring their purposes the better
to passe, as also to winne further credit unto the counterfet art
which they professe, they procure confederates, whereby they worke
wonders. And when they have either learning, eloquence, or 266.
nimblenesse of hands to accompanie their confederacie, or rather j.
knaverie, then (forsooth) they passe the degree of witches, and intitle vidcPM-
themselves to the name of conjurors. And these deale with no infe- %fs^'h^rese-
riour causes : these fetch divels out of hell, and angels out of heaven ; <■'>' catai. de
these raise up what bodies they list, though they were dead, buried,
and rotten long before ; and fetch soules out of heaven or hell with
much more expedition than the pope bringeth them out of purgatorie.
These I saie (among the simple, and where they feare no law nor
accusation) take upon them also the raising of tempests, and earth-
quakes, and to doo as much as God himselfe can doo. These are no
small fooles, they go not to worke with a baggage tode, or a cat, as 7. ivinnsin
witches doo ; but with a kind of majestie, and with authoritie they ^iTrMa^da-
call up by name, and have at their commandement seventie and nine '«"««'"•
principall and princelie divels, who have under them, as their minis-
ters, a great multitude of legions of pettie divels ; as for example.

effects of divcls and spirits, of their severall segniories and de-

HEIR first and principall king (which is of the power of
the east) is called Baell ; who when he is conjured up,
appeareth with three heads ; the first, like a tode ; the
second, like a man ; the third, like a cat. He speaketh
with a hoarse voice, he maketh a man go invisible, he hath under his
obedience and rule sixtie and six legions of divels.

The first duke under the power of the east, is named Agares, he
commeth up mildlie in the likenes of a faire old man, riding upon a
crocodile, and carrieng a hawke on his fist ; hee teacheth presentlie
all maner of toongs, he fetcheth backe all such as runne awaie, and
maketh them runne that stand still ; he overthroweth all dignities
jyS. supernaturall and temporall, hee maketh earthquakes, and is of the
order of vertues, having under his regiment thirtie one legions.

Marbas, *alias Barbas is a great president, and appeareth in the
forme of a mightie lion ; but at the commandement of a conjuror
commeth up in the likenes of a man, and answereth fullie as touching
anie thing which is hidden or secret : he bringeth diseases, and
cureth them, he promoteth wisedome, and the knowledge of mechani-
call arts, or handicrafts ; he changeth men into other shapes, and
under his presidencie or gouvernement are thirtie six legions of divels
conteined.

Anion, or Aatnon, is a great and mightie marques, and commeth
abroad in the likenes of a woolfe, having a serpents taile, spetting
267. out and breathing flames of fier ; when he putteth on the shape of a
man, he sheweth out dogs teeth, and a great head like to a mightie
raven ; he is the strongest prince of all other, and understandeth of
all things past and to come, he procureth favor, and reconcileth both
freends and foes, and ruleth fourtie legions of divels.

Barbatos, a great countie or earle, and also a duke, he appeareth in
Signo sagittarii sylvestris, with foure kings, which bring companies
and great troopes. He understandeth the singing of birds, the bark-
ing of dogs, the lowings of bullocks, and the voice of all living
creatures. He detecteth treasures hidden by magicians and in-
chanters, and is of the order of vertues, which in part beare rule :
he knoweth all things past, and to come, and reconcileth freends

and powers ; and governeth thirtie legions of divels by his au-
thoritie.

Biicr is a great president, and is scene in this signe ; he absolutelie Bucr.
teacheth philosophic niorall and naturall, and also logicke, and the
vertue of hcrbes : he giveth the best familiars, he can hcale all
diseases, speciallie of men, and reigneth over fiftie legions.

Giisoin is a great duke, and a strong, appearing in the forme of a Gusoin.
Xeiwphilus, he answereth all things, present, past, and to come, ex-
pounding all questions. He reconcileth freendship, and distributeth
honours and dignities, and ruleth over fourtie legions of divcls.

Boiis, otherwise Otis, a great president and an earle he com- Botis.
meth foorth in the shape of an ouglie viper, and if he put on J7g.
humane shape, he sheweth great teeth, and two homes, carrieng a
sharpe sword in his hand : he giveth answers of things present,
past, and to come, and reconcileth friends, and foes, ruling sixtie
legions.

Batnn, sometimes called iMatnin, a great duke and a strong, he Bathm.
is seene in the shape of a verie strong man, with a serpents taile,
sitting on a pale horsse, understanding the vertues of hearbs and
pretious stones, transferring men suddenlie from countrie to countrie,
and ruleth thirtie legions of divels.

Pioson, *ai(is Curson, a great king, he commeth foorth like a man Purson.
with a lions face, carrieng a most cruell viper, and riding on a beare ; t* ^^'^^■^
and before him go alwaies trumpets, he knoweth things hidden, and
can tell all things present, past, and to come : he bewraieth treasure,
he can take a bodie either humane or aierie ; he answereth truelie of
all things earthlie and secret, of the divinitie and creation of the world,
and bringeth foorth the best familiars ; and there obeie him two and
twentie legions of divels, partlie of the order of vertues, & partlie of
the order of thrones.

Eligor, *alias Abigor, is a great duke, and appeereth as a EUgor.
goodlie knight, carrieng a lance, an ensigne, and a scepter : he
answereth fullie of things hidden, and of warres, and how
souldiers should meete : he knoweth things to come, and pro-
cureth the favour of lords and knights, governing sixtie legions of
divels.

Lemie, *alias Oray, a great marquesse, shewing himselfe in the like- Leraie.
nesse of a galant archer, carrieng a bowe and a quiver, he is author 268.
of all battels, he dooth putrifie all such wounds as are made with

to whom he maketh himselfe acquainted, till he hath brought them to
the gallowes, and ruleth ten legions.

.Vor.j.r. Mora.r, * alias Fo7-aii, a great carle and a president, he is seene like

"^ a bull, and if he take unto him a mans face, he maketh men wonder-

full cunning in astronomic, & in all the liberall sciences : he givcth
good familiars and wise, knowing the power & vertuc of hearbs and
380. stones which are pretious, and ruleth thirtie six legions.

Ifos. Ipos, *alias Ayporos, is a great earle and a prince, appeering in the

shape of an angell, and yet indeed more obscure and filthie than a lion,
with a lions head, a gooses feet, and a hares taile : he knoweth things
to come and past, he maketh a man wittie, and bold, and hath under
his jurisdiction thirtie six legions.

Nabc-rius. Naberitts, *alias Cerberus^ is a valiant marquesse, shewing himselfe

in the forme of a crowe, when he speaketh with a hoarse voice : he
maketh a man amiable and cunning in all arts, and speciallie in
rhetorikc, he procureth the losse of prelacies and dignities : nineteene
legions heare and obeie him.

Giasya La- Glasya Labolas, *alias Caaci'inolaas, or Caasstmolar, is a great

president, who commeth foorth like a dog, and hath wings like a griffen,
he givcth the knowledge of arts, and is the captaine of all mansleiers:
he understandeth things present and to come, he gaineth the minds
and love of freends and foes, he maketh a man go invisible, and hath
the rule of six and thirtie legions.

z,-par. Zepar is a great duke, appearing as a souldier, inflaming women

with the loove of men, and when he is bidden he changeth their
shape, untill they male enjoie their beloved, he also maketh them
barren, and six and twentie legions are at his obeie and com-
mandement.

Bilcth. Bileth is a great king and a terrible, riding on a pale horsse, before

whome go trumpets, and all kind of melodious musicke. When he is
called up by an exorcist, he appeareth rough and furious, to deceive
him. Then let the exorcist or conjuror take heed to himself, and to
allaie his courage, let him hold a hazell bat in his hand, wherewithal!
he must reach out toward the east and south, and make a triangle
without besides the circle ; but if he hold not out his hand unto him,
and he bid him come in, and he still refuse the bond or chaine of
spirits ; let the conjuror proceed to reading, and by and by he will
submit himselfe, and come in, and doo whatsoever the exorcist com-
mandeth him, and he shalbe safe. If Bilcth the king be more
stubborne, and refuse to enter into the circle at the first call, and the
conjuror shew himselfe fearfull, or if he have not the chaine of spirits,
certeinclie he will never feare nor regard him after. Also, if the
place be unapt for a triangle to be made without the circle, then set

commeth out of his house, with his fellowes, and that the foresaid

Bileth will be his helper, his friend, and obedient unto him when he

commeth foorth. And when he commeth, let the exorcist receive him

courteouslie, and glorifie him in his pride, and therfore he shall

adore him as other kings doo, bicause he saith nothing without other

princes. Also, if he be cited by an exorcist, alwaies a silver ring of

the middle finger of the left hand must be held against the exorcists

face, as they doo for Amaiinon. And the dominion and power of so Vide Amai-

great a prince is not to be pretermitted ; for there is none under the

power & dominion of the conjuror, but he that deteineth both men

and women in doting love, till the exorcist hath had his pleasure.

He is of the orders of powers, hoping to returne to the seaventh

throne, which is not altogether credible, and he ruleth eightie five

legions.

Sitri, *alias Biiru, is a great prince, appeering with the face of a 5;-abaw-
leopard, and having Avings as a griffen : when he taketh humane shape, ^'^^ dneii.
he is verie beautifull, he inflameth a man with a womans love, and
also stin-eth up women to love men, being commanded he willinglie

to make them luxuriouslie naked, and there obeie him sixtie
legions.

is heere to be understood he that was drowned in the depth of his
knowledge : he would needs be like God,, and for his arrogancie was
throwne out into destruction, of whome it is said ; Everie pretious Ezech. S8.
stone is thy covering. Paimon is constrained by divine vertue to
stand before the exorcist ; where he putteth on the likenesse of a
man : he sitteth on a beast called a dromedarie, which is a swift
runner, and weareth a glorious crowne, and hath an effeminate
countenance. There goeth before him an host of men with trumpets
and well sounding cymbals, and all musicall instruments. At the
first he appeereth with a great crie and roring, as in Circulo Salomonis,
and in the art is declared. And if this Paimon speake sometime that
the conjuror understand him not, let him not therefore be dismaied.
But when he hath delivered him the first obligation, to observe his
desire, he must bid him also answer him distinctlie and plainelie to
the questions he shall aske you, of all philosophie, wisedome, and jS2.
science, and of all other secret things. And if you will knowe the
disposition of the world, and what the earth is, or what holdeth it up
in the water, or any other thing, or what is Abyssus, or where the
wind is, or from whence it commeth, he will teach you aboundantlie.
Consecrations also as well of sacrifices as otherwise maybe reckoned.

He giveth dignities and confirmations ; he bindeth them that resist
him in his owne chaines, and subjecteth them to the conjuror ; he
prepareth good familiars, and hath the understanding of all arts.
Note, that at the calling up of him, the exorcist must looke towards
the northwest, bicause there is his house. When he is called up, let
the exorcist receive him constantlie without feare, let him aske what
questions or demands he list, and no doubt he shall obteine the same

270. of him. And the exorcist must beware he forget not the creator, for
those things, which have beene rehearsed before oi PaiJiwn, some saie
he is of the order of dominations ; others saie, of the order of cherubim.
There follow him two hundred legions, partlie of the order of angels,
and partlie of potestates. Note that if Paimon be cited alone by an
offering or sacrifice, two kings followe him ; to wit, Beball & Abalam^
& other potentates : in his host are twentie five legions, bicause the
spirits subject to them are not alwaies with them, except they be
compelled to appeere by divine vertue.

Some saie that the king Beliall was created immediatlie after
Lticifer, and therefore they thinke that he was father and seducer'of
them which fell being of the orders. For he fell first among the
worthier and wiser sort, which went before Miciael SLXid other heavenlie
angels, which were lacking. Although Beliall went before all them
that were throwne downe to the earth, yet he went not before them
that tarried in heaven. This Beliall is constrained by divine vertue,
when he taketh sacrifices, gifts, and offerings, that he againe may
give unto the offerers true .answers. But he tarrieth not one houre in
the truth, except he be constrained by the divine power, as is said.
He taketh the forme of a beautiful! angell, sitting in a firie chariot ;
he speaketh faire, he distributeth preferments of senatorship, and the
favour of friends, and excellent familiars : he hath rule over eightie
legions, partlie of the order of vertues, partlie of angels ; he

j8j. is found in the forme of an exorcist in the bonds of spirits. The
exorcist must consider, that this Beliall doth in everie thing assist
his subjects. If he will not submit himselfe, let the bond of spirits
be read : the spirits chaine is sent for him, wherewith wise Salomon
gathered them togither with their legions in a brasen vessel!, where
were inclosed among all the legions seventie two kings, of whome
the cheefe was Bileth, the second was Beliall, the third Asvwday,
and above a thousand thousand legions. Without doubt (I must
confesse) I learned this of my maister Salomon ; but he told me not
why lie gathered them together, and shut them up so : but I beleeve
it was for the pride of this Beliall. Certeine nigromancers doo saie,
that Salomon, being on a certeine daie seduced by the craft of a
certeine woman, inclined himselfe to praie before the same idol!,

Beliall by name : which is not credible. And therefore we must

rather thinke (as it is said) that they were gathered together in that

great brasen vessell for pride and arrogancie, and throwne into a

deepe lake or hole in Babylon. For wise Salomon did accomplish

his workes by the divine power, which never forsooke him. And

therefore we must thinke he worshipped not the image Beliall ; for

then he could not have constrained the spirits by divine vertue : for

this Beliall, with three kings were in the lake. But the Babylonians The Baby-

woondering at the matter, supposed that they should find therein a app'ohne'd^'

great quantitie of treasure, and therefore with one consent went

downe into the lake, and uncovered and brake the vessell, out of the

which immediatlie flew the capteine divels, and were delivered to

their former and proper places. But this Beliall entred into a certeine

image, and there gave answer to them that offered and sacrificed

unto him : as Toes, in his sentences reporteth, and the Babylonians

did worship and sacrifice thereunto.

saith he fell not of his owne accord. He maketh a man woonderfull
learned in the liberall sciences, he ruleth fourtie legions. Let everie
exorcist take heed, that he admit him not too neere him, bicause of
his stinking breath. And therefore let the conjuror hold neere to his
face a magicall ring, and that shall defend him.

Foras, *alias Forcas is a great president, and is scene in the forme
of a strong man, and in humane shape, he understandeth the vertue
of hearbs and pretious stones : he teacheth fullie logicke, ethicke,
and their parts : he maketh a man invisible, wittie, eloquent, and to

before others, which are under the power of Afuaynon. When the
conjuror exerciseth this office, let him be abroad, let him be warie
and standing on his feete ; if his cap be on his head, he will cause
all his dooings to be bewraied, which if he doo not, the exorcist
shalbe deceived by Amaymon in everie thing. But so soone as he

To all demands he answereth fullie and trulie, he maketh a man
invisible, he sheweth the places where treasure lieth, and gardeth it,
if it be among the legions of Amaymon, he hath under his power
seventie two legions.

Gaap, *alias Tap, a great president and a prince, he appeareth in a Gi-^ap.
meridionall signe, and when he taketh humane shape he is the guide
of the foure principall kings, as mightie as Bileth. There were cer-
teine necromancers that offered sacrifices and burnt offerings unto
him ; and to call him up, they exercised an art, saieng that Salomon
the wise made it. Which is false : for it was rather Cham, the sonne
of Noah, who after the floud began first to invocate wicked spirits.
He invocated Bileth, and made an art in his name, and a booke
which is knowne to manie mathematicians. There were burnt offer-
ings and sacrifices made, and gifts given, and much wickednes
wrought by the exorcists, who mingled therewithal! the holie names
of God, the which in that art are everie where expressed. Marie
there is an epistle of those names written by Salomon, as also write
Helias Hierosolymitanus and Hcliscens. It is to be noted, that if
anie exorcist have the art of Bileth, and cannot make him stand
before him, nor see him, I may not bewraie how and declare the
meanes to conteine him, bicause it is abhomination, and for that
I have learned nothing from Salomon of his dignitie and office.
But yet I will not hide this ; to wit, that he maketh a man woon-

rich man, or at least that gained any thing that waie ; or any un-
learned man, that became learned by that meanes ; or any happie
man, that could with the helpe of this art either deliver himselfe, or
his freends, from adversitie, or adde unto his estate any point of
felicitie: yet these men, in all worldlie happinesse, must needs exceed
all others ; if such things could be by them accomplished, according
as it is presupposed. For if they may learne of Marbas, all secrets,
and to cure all diseases ; and of Furcas^ wisdome, and to be cunning
in all mechanicall arts ; and to change anie mans shape, of Zepar : if
Bu7ie can make them rich and eloquent, if Bej-oth can tell them of all
things, present, past, and to come ; if Asmodaie can make them go
invisible and shew them all hidden treasure ; if Salmacke will afflict
whom they list, & Allocer can procure them the love of any woman ;
\{ Amy can provide them excellent familiars, if Caym can make them
understand the voice of all birds and beasts, and Buer and Bifrons
397- can make them live long ; and finallie, if Ortasf could procure unto
them great friends, and reconcile their enimies, & they in the end
had all these at commandement ; should they not live in all worldlie
honor and felicitie? whereas contrariwise they lead their lives in all
obloquie, miserie, and beggerie, and in fine come to the gallowes ; as
though they had chosen unto themselves the spirit Valeer, who they
saie bringeth all them with whom he entreth into familiaritie, to no
better end than the gibet or gallowes. But before I proceed further
to the confutation of this stuffe, I will shew other conjurations, de-
vised more latelie, and of more authoritie ; wherein you shall see how
fooles are trained to beleeve these absurdities, being woone
by little and little to such credulitie. For the author

An experiment of the dead.

IRST fast and praie three dales, and absteine thee from
all filthinesse ; go to one that is new buried, such a one
as killed himselfe or destroied himselfe wilfullie : or else
get thee promise of one that shalbe hanged, and let him
sweare an oth to thee, after his bodie is dead, that his spirit shall
come to thee, and doo thee true service, at thy commandements, in
all dales, houres, and mlnuts. And let no persons see thy doings, but
thy *fellow. And about eleven a clocke in the night, go to the place
where he was buried, and saie with a bold faith & hartie desire, to
have the spirit come that thou doost call for, thy fellow having a
candle in his left hand, and in his right hand a christall stone, and
saie these words following, the maister having a hazell wand in his

Amen.

The maister standing at the head of the grave, his fellow having
in his hands the candle and the stone, must begin the conjuration as
foUoweth, and the spirit will appeare to you in the christall stone,
in a faire forme of a child of twelve yeares of age. And when

for he or shee will shew manie delusions, to drive you from your

followeth.

I conjure thee spirit A^. by the living God, the true God, and by
the holie God, and by their vertues and powers which have created
both thee and me, and all the world. I conjure thee N. by these
holie names of God, ^Tetragrmnmaton >^ Adonay ^ Algraniay ^

by the which God gave power to man, both to speake or
thinke ; so by their vertues and powers I conjure thee spirit
A'', that now immediatlie thou doo appeare in this christall
stone, visiblie to me and to my fellow, without anie tarrieng
or deceipt. I conjure thee N. by the excellent name of Jesus
Christ A and ^. the first and the last. For this holie name
of Jesus is above all names : for in this name of Jesus
everie knee dooth bow and obeie, both of heavenlie things,
earthlie things, and infernall. And everie toong doth confesse,
that our Lord Jesus Christ is in the glorie of the father : neither is
there anie other name given to man, whereby he must be saved.
Therefore in the name of Jesus of Nazareth, and by his nativitie,
resurrection, and ascension, and by all that apperteineth unto his
passion, and by their vertues and powers I conjure thee spirit A^. that
thou doo appeare visiblie in this christall stone to me, and to my
fellow, without anie dissimulation. I conjure thee A^. by the bloud of
the innocent lambe Jesus Christ, which was shed for us upon the
crosse : for all those that* doo beleeve in the vertue of his bloud,
shalbe saved. I conjure thee A', by the vertues and powers of all the
riall names and words of the living God of me pronounced, that thou
be obedient unto me and to my words rehearsed. If thou refuse .his
to doo, I by the holie trinitie, and their vertues and powers doo con-

a place where is paine upon paine, dailie, horrihlie, and lamentablie,

me and to my fellow visiblie, immediatlie in this christall stone, and
in a faire forme and shape of a child of twelve yeares of age, and that
thou alter not thy shape, I charge thee upon paine of everlasting con-
demnation. I conjure thee spirit N. by the golden girdle, which
girded the loines of our Lord Jesus Christ : so thou spirit N. be thou
bound into the perpetuall paines of hell fier, for thy disobedience and
unreverent regard, that thou hast to the holie names and words, and
his precepts. I conjure thee A^. by the two edged sword, which ^w;
sawe proceed out of the mouth of the almightie ; and so thou spirit
N. be torne and* cut in peeces with that sword, and to be condemned
into everlasting paine, where the fier goeth not out, and where the
worme dieth not. I conjure thee N. by the heavens, and by the
celestial! citie of Jerusaiem, and by the earth and the sea, and by al!
things conteined in them, and by their vertues & powers. I conjure
thee spirit A^. by tlie obedience that thou doost owe unto the principal!
prince. And except thou spirit A', doo come and appeare in this
christall stone visiblie in my presence, here immediatlie as it is afore-
said. Let the great cursse of God, the anger of God, the shadowe
and darknesse of death, and of eternal! condemnation be upon thee
spirit A^. for ever and ever ; bicause thou hast denied thy faith, thy
health, & salvation. For thy great disobedience, thou art worthie to
be condemned. Therefore let the divine trinitie, thrones, dominions,
principats, potestats, virtutes, cherubim and seraphim, and all the
soules of saints, both of men and women, condemne thee for ever,
and be a witnesse against thee at the daie of judgement, bicause of

such paine as he is in, ! charge thee spirit A^. that thou shalt not go

fore by all these foresaid vertues and powers, I doo bind you and
constreine you into my will and power ; that you being thus bound,
may come unto me in great humilitie, and to appeare in your
circles before me visiblie, in faire forme and shape of mankind
kings, and to obeie unto me in all things, whatsoever I shall desire,
and that you may not depart from me without my licence. And if
you doo against my precepts, I will promise unto you that you shall
descend into the profound deepenesse of the sea, except that you
doo obeie unto me, in the part of the living sonne of God, which
liveth and reigneth in the unitie of the Holie-ghost, by all world of
worlds, Amen.

Sale this true conjuration five courses, and then shalt thou see
come out of the northpart five kings, with a marvelous companie :
which when they are come to the circle, they will allight downe off
from their horsses, and will kneele downe before thee, saieng :
Maister, command us what thou wilt, and we will out of hand be
obedient unto thee. Unto whome thou shall saie ; See that ye
depart not from me, without my licence ; and that which I will
command you to doo, let it be done trulie, surelie, faithfullie and
essentiallie. And then they all will sweare unto thee to doo all
thy will. And after they have sworne, saie the conjuration imme-
diatlie following.

I conjure, charge, and command you, and everie of you, * Sirrael,
\Malanthan, Thaniaor^ Falaur, and Siiranii, you infernall kings, to
put into this christall stone one spirit learned and expert in all arts
and sciences, by the vertue of this name of God Tetrae;rammato7i,
and by the crosse of our Lord Jesu Christ, and by the bloud of the
innocent lambe, which redeemed all the world, and by all their
vertues & powers I charge you, ye noble kings, that the said
spirit may teach, shew, and declare unto me, and to my freends, at
all houres and minuts, both night and daie, the truth of all things,
both bodilie and ghostlie, in this world, whatsoever I shall request
or desire, declaring also to me my verie name. And this I command
in your part to doo, and to obeie thereunto, as unto your owne lord
and maister. That done, they will call a certeine spirit, whom they
will command to enter into the centre of the circled or round
christall. Then put the christall betweene the two circles, and thou
shalt see the christall made blacke.

HIS is proved the noblest carrier that ever did serve anie
man upon the earth, & here beginneth the inclosing of
the said spirit, & how to have a true answer of him,
without anie craft or harme ; and he will appeare unto
thee in the likenesse of a faire man, or faire woman, the which spirit
will come to thee at all times. And if thou wilt command him to
tell thee of hidden treasures that be in anie place, he will tell it thee :
or if thou wilt command him to bring to thee gold or silver, he will
bring it thee : or if thou wilt go from one countrie to another, he
will beare thee without anie harme of bodie or soule. Therefore
* he that will doo this worke, shall absteine from lecherousnes and
dronkennesse, and from false swearing, and doo all the abstinence
that he may doo ; and namelie three daies before he go to worke,
and in the third dale, when the night is come, and when the starres
doo shine, and the element faire and cleare, he shall bath himselfe
and his fellowes (if he have anie) all together in a quicke welspring.
Then he inust be cloathed in cleane white cloathes, and he must
have another privie place, and beare with him inke and pen, where-
with he shall write this holy name of God almightie in his right hand

he must have a drie thong of a lions or of a harts skin, and make

that they should take another waie, for dread of perill, that Herod
the king by his ordinance would have destroied these *three noble
kings, that meekelie sought out our Lord and saviour. As wittilie

The xxi. Chapter.




A confutation of conjuration^ especiallie of the raisings binding
and dismissing of the divelt, of going invisible, and other lewd
practises.

HUS farre have we waded in shewing at large the vanitie
of necromancers, conjurors, and such as pretend to have
reall conference and consultation with spirits and divels :
wherein (I trust) you see what notorious blasphemie is
committed, besides other blind superstitious ceremonies, a disordered
heap, which are so far from building up the endevors of these blacke
art practitioners, that they doo altogether ruinate & overthrow
them, making them in their follies and falshoods as bare and naked
as an anatomie. As for these ridiculous conjurations, last rehearsed,
being of no small reputation among the ignorant, they are for the
most part made by T. R. (for so much of his name he bewraieth)
and fohni Cokars, invented and devised for the augmentation and
maintenance of their living, for the edifieng of the poore, and for the
propagating and inlarging of Gods glorie, as in the beginning of
their booke of conjurations they protest ; which in this place, for
the further manifestation of their impietie, and of the witchmongers
foUie and credulitie, I thought good to insert, whereby the residue of
their proceedings may be judged, or rather detected. For if we
seriouslie behold the matter of conjuration, and the drift of conjurors,
we shall find them, in mine opinion, more faultie than such as take
upon them to be witches, as manifest offenders against the majestic
of God, and his holie lawe, and as apparent violators of the lawes
and quietnesse of this realme : although indeed they bring no such
thing to passe, as is surmised and urged by credulous persons,
couseners. Hers, and witchmongers. For these are alwaies learned,
and rather abusers of others, than they themselves by others abused.
But let us see what appearance of truth or possibilitie is wrapped
within these mysteries, and let us unfold the deceipt. They have
made choice of certeine words, whereby they saie they can worke
miracles, &c. And first of all, that they call divels & soules out of

hell (though we find in the scriptures manifest proofes that all pas-
sages are stopped concerning the egresse out of hell) so as they may
go thither, but they shall never get out, for Ab meruo nulla est
redeviptio, out of hell there is no redemption. Well, when they have
gotten them up, they shut them in a circle made with chalke, which
is so stronglie beset and invironed with crosses and names, that they
cannot for their lives get out ; which is a verie probable matter.
Then can they bind them, and lose them at their pleasures, and
make them that have beene Hers from the beginning, to tell the truth :
yea, they can compell them to doo anie thing. And the divels are
forced to be obedient unto them, and yet cannot be brought to due
obedience unto God their creator. This done (I saie) they can worke
all maner of miracles (saving blew miracles) and this is beleeved of
manie to be true :

among his apostles and disciples for the confirmation of his gospell,
and the faith of his elect : yet I denie altogether, that he left that
power with these knaves, which hide their cousening purposes under
those lewd and foolish words, according to that which Peter saith ;
With feined words they make merchandize of you. And therfore
the counsel! is good that Paiile giveth us, when he biddeth us take
heed that no man deceive us with vaine words. For it is the Lord
only that worketh great woonders, and bringeth mightie things to
passe. It is also written, that Gods word, and not the words of
conjurors, or the charmes of witches, healeth all things, maketh
tempests, and stilleth them.

But put case the divell could be fetched up and fettered, and loosed
againe at their pleasure, &c : I marvell yet, that anie can be so
bewitched, as to be made to beleeve, that by vertue of their words,
anie earthlie creature can be made invisible. We thinke it a lie, to
saie that white is blacke, and blacke white : but it is a more shame-
lesse assertion to affirme, that white is not, or blacke is not at all ;

313. and yet more impudencie to hold that a man is a horsse ; but most
apparent impudencie to saie, that a man is no man, or to be extenu-
ated into such a quantitie, as therby he may be invisible, and yet
remaine in life and health, &c : and that in the cleare light of the
daie, even in the presence of them that are not blind. But surelie,

he that cannot make one haire white or blacke, whereof (on the
other side) not one falleth from the head without Gods speciall
providence, can never bring to passe, that the visible creature of
God shall become nothing, or lose the vertue and grace powred ther-
into by God the creator of all things.

If they saie that the divell covereth them with a cloud or veile, as
M. Mai. Bodtii, & mania other doo afifirme ; yet (me thinkes) we
should either see the cover, or the thing covered. And though per-
chance they saie in their harts ; Tush, the Lord seeth not, who
indeed hath blinded them, so as seeing, they see not : yet they shall
never be able to persuade the wise, but that both God and man dooth
see both them and their knaverie in this behalfe. I have heard of a
foole, who was made beleeve that he should go invisible, and naked ;
while he was well whipped by them, who (as he thought) could not
see him. Into which fooles paradise they saie* he was brought, that
enterprised to kill the prince of Orenge.

SEE no difference betweene these and popish conjurations;
for they agree in order, words, and matter, differing in no

gotten the upper hand over them. And bicause the papists shall be
without excuse in this behalfe, and that the world may see their
cousenage, impietie, and follie to be as great as the others, I will cite
one conjuration (of which sort I might cite a hundred) published by

be a crosse and a censer with frankincense, and therewithall the
place must be censed or perfumed, holie water must be sprinkled, and
a holie stoale must be used, and (after diverse other ceremonies) a
praier to God must be made, in maner and forme following :

O Lord Jesus Christ, the knower of all secrets, which alwaies
revealest all hoalsome and profitable things to thy faithfull children,
and which sufTerest a spirit to shew himselfe in this place, we beseech
thee for thy bitter passion, &c : vouchsafe to command this spirit, to
reveale and signifie unto us thy servants, without our terror or hurt,
what he is, to thine honour, and to his comfort ; In noi>iine patris,
&^c. And then proceed in these words : We beseech thee, for Christs
sake, O thou spirit, that if there be anie of us, or among us, whom
thou wouldest answer, name him, or else manifest him by some
signe. Is it frier P. or doctor D. or doctor Burc. or sir Feats, or sir
John, or sir Robert : Et sic de cceteris circunstatitibus. For it is well
tried (saith the glosse) he will not answer everie one. If the spirit-
make anie sound of voice, or knocking, at the naming of anie one, he
is the cousener (the conjuror I would saie) that must have the charge
of this conjuration or examination. And these forsooth must be the
interrogatories, to wit : Whose soule art thou ? Wherefore camest
thou 1 What wouldest thou have ? Wantest thou any suffrages,
masses, or almes ? How manie masses will serve thy turne, three,
six, ten, twentie, thirtie, «S:c.'* By what preest ? Must he be religious
or secular.'' Wilt thou have anie fasts? What ? How manie? How
great ? And by what persons ? Among hospitalles ? Lepres ? Or
beggars ? What shall be the signe of thy perfect deliverance ?
Wherefore liest thou in purgatorie ? And such like. This must be
doone in the night.

If there appeare no signe at this houre, it must be deferred untill
another houre. Holie water must be left in the place. There is no
feare (they saie) that such a spirit will hurt the conjuror : for he can
sinne no more, as being in the meane state betweene good and evill,
and as yet in the state of satisfaction. *If the spirit doo hurt, then it is
a damned soule, and not an elect. Everie man may not be present
hereat, speciallie such as be weake of complexion. They appeare
in diverse maners, not alwaies in bodie, or bodilie shape (as it is read
in the life of S. Martine, that the divell did) but sometimes invisible,
as onelie by sound, voice, or noise. Thus farre Jacobus de CInisa.

A late experiment, or cousening co7ijuration practised at Orleance
by the Franciscane Friers, how it was detected, and the judgement
against the authors of that comedie.

|N the yeare of our Lord 1534. at Orleance in France, the
Maiors wife died, willing and desiring to be buried with-
out anie pompe or noise, &c. Hir husband, who rever-
enced the memoriall of hir, did even as she had willed
him. And bicause she was buried in the church of the *Fraficiscans,
besides her father and grandfather, and gave them in reward onelie
six crownes, whereas they hoped for a greater preie ; shortlie after it
chanced, that as he felled certeine woods and sold them, they desired
him to give them some part thereof freelie without monie : which he
flatlie denied. This they tooke verie greevouslie. And whereas be-
fore they misliked him, now they conceived such displeasure as they
devised this meanes to be revenged; to wit, that his wife was damned
for ever. The cheefe workemen and framers of this tragedie were
Colimannus, and Stephanus Aterbatensis, both doctors of divinitie ;
this Colinian. was a great conjuror, & had all his implements in a
readines, which he was woont to use in such busines. And thus they
handled the matter. They place over the arches of the church, a
yoong novice ; who about midnight, when they came to mumble their
praiers, as they were woont to do, maketh a great rumbling, and noise.
Out of hand the moonks beganne to conjure and to charme, but he
answered nothing. Then being required to give a signe, whether he
were a dumme spirit or no, he beganne to rumble againe : which
thing they tooke as a certeine signe. Having laid this foundation,
they go unto certeine citizens, cheefe men, and such as favoured
them, declaring that a heavie chance had happened at home in their
monasterie ; not shewing what the matter was, but desiring them to
come to their mattens at midnight. When these citizens were come,
and that praiers were begunne, the counterfet spirit beginneth to
make a marvellous noise in the top of the church. And being asked
what he meant, and who he was, gave signes that it was not lawfull

for him to speake. Therefore they commanded him to make answer
by tokens and signes to certeine things they would demand of him.
Now was there a hole made in the vawt, through the which he might
heare and understand the voice of the conjuror. And then had he in
his hand a litle boord, which at everie question, he strake, in such
sort as he might easilie be heard beneath. First they asked him,
whether he were one of them that had beene buried in the same
place. Afterwards they reckoning manie by name, which had beene
buried there ; at the last also they name the Maiors wife : and there
by and by the spirit gave a signe that he was hir soule. He was
further asked, whether he were damned or no ; and if he were, for
what cause, for what desert, or fault ; whether for covetousnes, or
wanton lust, for pride or want of charitie j or whether it were for
316. heresie, or for the sect of Luther\ newlie sproong up : also what he
meant by that noise and stirre he kept there ; whether it were to have
the bodie now buried in holie ground to be digged up againe, and
laid in some other place. To all which points he answered by signes,
as he was commanded, by the which he affirmed or denied anie thing,
according as he strake the boord twise or thrise together. And when
he had thus given them to understand, that* the verie cause of his
damnation was Luthers heresie, and that the bodie must needs be
digged up againe : the moonks requested the citizens, whose presence
they had used or rather abused, that they would beare witnesse of
those things which they had seene with their eies ; and that they
would subscribe to such things as were doone a few days before. The
citizens taking good advise on the matter, least they should offend the
Maior, or bring themselves in trouble, refused so to doo. But the
moonks notwithstanding take from thence the sweete bread, which
they called the host and bodie of our Lord, with all the relikes of
saintes, and carrie them to another place, and there saie their masse.
4^y. The bishops substitute judge (whome they called Officiall) under-
standing that matter, commeth thither, accompanied with certeine
honest men, to the intent he might knowe the whole circumstance
more exactlie : and therefore he commandeth them to make conjura-
tion in his presence ; and also he requireth certeine to be chosen to
go up into the top of the vawt, and there to see whether any ghost
appeered or not. Stephanas Aterbatensis stiffelie denied that to be
lawfull, and marvellouslie persuading the contrarie, affirmed that the
spirit in no wise ought to be troubled. And albeit the Official urged
them verie much, that there might be some conjuring of the spirit ;
yet could he nothing prevaile.

journie to the king, and opened the whole matter unto him. And
bicause the moonks refused judgement upon plea of their owne lawes
and liberties, the king choosing out certeine of the aldermen oi Paris,
giveth them absolute and full authoritie to make inquirie of the
matter. The like dooth the Chancelor maister Anthojtius Pratensis
cardinall and legat for the pope throughout France. Therefore, when
they had no exception to alledge, they were conveied unto Paris, and
there constrained to make their answer. But yet could nothing be
wroong out of them by confession, whereupon they were put apart
into divers prisons : the novice being kept in the house of maister
Fumanus, one of the aldermen, was oftentimes examined, and earn-
estlie requested to utter the truth, but would notwithstanding confesse
nothing ; bicause he feared that the moonks would afterwards put him
to death for staining their order, and putting it to open shame. But
when the judges had made him sure promise that he should escape
punishment, and that he should never come into their handling, he
opened unto them the whole matter as it was doone : and being
brought before his fellowes, avouched the same to their faces. The
moonks, albeit they were convicted, and by these meanes almost
taken tarde* with the deed doing ; yet did they refuse the judges,
bragging and vaunting themselves on their priviledges, but all in
vaine. For sentence passed upon them, and they were condemned
to be carried backe againe to Orleatice, and there to be cast in prison,
and so should finallie be brought foorth into the cheefe church of the
citie openlie, and from thence to the place of execution, where they
should make open confession of their trespasses.

Surelie this was most common among moonks and friers, who

mainteined their religion, their lust, their liberties, their pompe, their

wealth, their estimation and knaverie by such cousening practises.

Now I will shew you more speciall orders of popish conjurations, that

are so shameleslie admitted into the church of Rome, that they are

not onelie suffered, but commanded to be used, not by night secretlie,

but by dale impudentlie. And these forsooth concerne the

curing of bewitched persons, and such as are possessed ; to

wit, such as have a divell put into them by witches

inchantments. And herewithall I will set

HOMAS AQUINAS saith, that anie bodie, though he be
of an inferior or superior order, yea though of none order
at all (and as Guliebnus Durandus glossator Raitnundi
affirmeth, a woman so she blesse not the girdle or the
garment, but the person of the bewitched) hath power to exercise the
order of an exorcist or conjuror, even as well as any preest may saie
masse in a house unconsecrated. But that is (saith M. Mai.) rather
through the goodnesse and licence of the pope, than through the
grace of the sacrament. Naie, there are examples set downe, where
some being bewitched were cured (as AI. Mai. taketh it) without any
conjuration at all. Marrie there were certeine Pater nosters, Aves, and
Credos] said, and crosses made, but they are charmes, they saie,
and no conjurations. For they saie that such charmes are lawfull,
bicause there is no superstition in them, &c.

And it is woorth my labour, to shew you how papists define
superstition, and how they expound the definition thereof. Supersti-
tion (saie they) is a religion observed beyond measure, a religion
practised with evill and unperfect circumstances. Also, whatsoever
usurpeth the name of religion, through humane tradition, without the
popes authoritie, is superstitious : as to adde or joine anie hymnes
to the masse, to interrupt anie diriges, to to* abridge anie part of
the creed in the singing thereof, or to sing when the organs go,
and not when the quier singeth, not to have one tohelpe the priest to
masse : and such like, &c.

These popish exorcists doo manie times forget their owne rules.
For they should not directlie in their conjurations call upon the divell
(as they doo) with intreatie, but with authoritie and commandement.
Neither should they have in their charmes and conjurations anie un-
knowne names. Neither should there be (as alwaies there is) anie
falshood conteined in the matter of the charme of conjuration,
as (saie they) old women have in theirs, when they saie ; The
blessed virgine passed over Jordan, and then S. Steven met hir,
and asked hir, &c. Neither should they have anie other vaine
characters, but the crosse (for those are the words:) and manie other

Chap. 24.

such cautions have they, which they observe not, for they have made
it lavvfull elsewhere.

But Thomas their cheefe piller prooveth their conjuring and charmes
lawfull by S. Marke, who saith ; Signa eos qtti crediderunt ; And,
Iti nomine meo dcemonia ejicient, &^c : whereby he also prooveth that
they maie conjure serpents. And there he taketh paines to proove,
that the words of God are of as great holinesse as relikes of saints,
whereas (in such respect as they meane) they are both alike, and in-
deed nothing woorth. And I can tell them further, that so they maie
be carried, as either of them maie doo a man much harme either in
bodie or soule.

But they proove this by S. Angusthie, saieng ; Non est minus
verbum Dei, quam corpus Christi : whereupon they conclude thus ;
By all mens opinions it is lawfull to carrie about reverentlie the relikes
of saints ; Ergo it is lawfull against evill spirits, to invocate the name
of God everie waie ; by the Pater noster, the Ave, the nativitie, the
passion, the five wounds, the title triumphant, by the seven words
spoken on the crosse, by the nailes, &c : and there maie be hope
reposed in them. Yea, they saie it is lawfull to conjure all things,
bicause the divell maie have power in all things. And first, alwaies
the person or thing, wherein the divell is, must be exorcised, and then
the divell must be conjured. Also they affirme, that it is as expedient
to consecrate and conjure porrage and meate, as water and salt, or
such like things.

The right order of exorcisme in rebaptisme of a person possessed
or bewitched, requireth that exsufflation and abrenunciation be doone
toward the west. Item, there must be erection of hands, confession,
profession, oration, benediction, imposition of hands, denudation and
unction, with holie oile after baptisme, communion, and induition of
the surplis. But they saie that this needeth not, where the bewitched
is exorcised : but that the bewitched be first confessed, and then to
hold a candle in his hand, and in steed of a surplise to tie about his
bare bodie a holie candle of the length of Christ, or of the crosse
whereupon he died, which for monie maie be had at Rome. Ergo
(saith M. Mai.) this maie be said ; I conjure thee Peter or Barbara
being sicke, but regenerate in the holie water of baptisme, by the living
God, by the true God, by the holie God, by the God which redeemed
thee with his pretious bloud, that thou maiest be made a conjured
man, that everie fantasie and wickednesse of diabolicall deceipt doo
avoid and depart from thee, and that everie uncleane spirit be conjured
through him that shall come to judge the quicke and the dead, and
the world by fier. Amen : Oremus, &c. And this conjuration, with
Oremus, and a praier, must be thrise repeated, and at the end alwaies

must be said ; Ergo 7naledicte diabole recognosce sententiam tuam,
&^c. And this order must alwaies be followed. And finallie, there
must be diligent search made, in everie corner, and under everie
coverlet and pallet, and under everie threshhold of the doores, for
instruments of witchcraft. And if anie be found, they must streight-
waie be throwne into the fier. Also they must change all their bed-
ding, their clothing, and their habitation. And if nothing be found,
the partie that is to be exorcised or conjured, must come to the church
rath in the morning : and the holier the dale is, the better, speciallie
our Ladie daie. And the preest, if he be shriven himselfe and in
perfect state, shall doo the better therein. And let him that is ex-
orcised hold a holie candle in his hand, &c. Alwaies provided, that
the holie water be throwne upon him, and a stoale put about his necke,
with Deus in adjutorinm^ and the Letanie, with invocation of saints.
And this order maie continue thrise a weeke, so as (saie they) through
multiplication of intercessors, or rather intercessions, grace maie be
obteined, and favor procured.

There is also some question in the Romish church, whether the
sacrament of the altar is to be received before or after the exorcisme.
Item in shrift, the confessor must learne whether the partie be not
excommunicate, and so for want of absolution, endure this vexation.
Thomas sheweth the difference betwixt holie water and conjuration,
saieng that holie water driveth the divell awaie from the externall and
outward parts ; but conjurations from the internall and inward
parts ; and therefore unto the bewitched partie both are to be
applied.

The seven reasons why some are not rid of the divell with all
their popish conjurations, why there were no conjurors in the
primitive church, and why the divell is not so soone cast out of
the bewitched as of the possessed.

HE reason why some are not remedied for all their con-
jurations, the papists say is for seven causes. First, for
that the faith of the slanders by is naught ; secondlie, for
that theirs that present the partie is no better ; thirdlie,
bicause of the sinnes of the bewitched ; fourthlie, for the neglecting
of meete remedies ; fiftlie, for the reverence of vertues going out into
others ; sixtlie, for the purgation ; seventhlie, for the merit of the
partie bewitched. And lo, the first foure are proved by Matthew the
7. and Marke the 4. when one presented his Sonne, and the multitude

was for their incredulitie ; saieng that if they had as much faith as a

is prooved by Vitas patrum, the lives of the fathers, where it appeereth

•that S. Anthonie could not doo that cure, when his scholar Paule

could doo it, and did it. For the proofe of the sixt excuse it is said,

that though the fault be taken awaie therby ; yet it followeth not

that alwaies the punishment is released. Last of all it is said,

that it is possible that the divell was not conjured out of the partie

before baptisme by the exorcist, or the midwife hath not baptised him

well, but omitted some part of the sacrament. If any object that Why there

there were no exorcists in the primitive church, it is answered, that conjurors

or talke in their sleepe ; for (saie they) call them by their names, and
presentlie they wake, or fall if they clime : whereby it is gathered,
that they are not trulie named in baptisme. Item they saie, it is
somewhat more difficult to conjure the divell out of one bewitched,
than out of one possessed : bicause in the bewitched, he is double ;
in the other single. They have a hundred such beggerlie, foolish, and
frivolous notes in this behalfe.

imagination of their minds, and both can and also will doo any thing
for them. For if anie that meaneth good faith with the divell read
certeine conjurations, he commeth up (they saie) at a trice. Marrie
if another that hath none intent to raise him, read or pronounce the
words, he will not stirre. And yet J. Bodin confesseth, that he is
afraid to read such conjurations, as John Wierus reciteth ; least
(belike) the divell would come up, and scratch him with his fowle
long nailes. In which sort I woonder that the divell dealeth with
none other, than witches and conjurors. I for my part have read a
number of their conjurations, but never could see anie divels of
theirs, except it were in a plaie. But the divell (belike) knoweth my
mind ; to wit, that I would be loth to come within the compasse of
his clawes. But lo what reason such people have. Bodin, Bartholo-
meus Spineus, Sprenger, and Inslitor, &c : doo constantlie afifirme,
that witches are to be punished with more extremitie than conjurors ;
and sometimes with death, when the other are to be pardoned doing
the same offense : bicause (say they) the witches make a league with
321. the divell, & so doo not conjurors. Now if conjurors make no league
by their owne confession, and divels indeed know not our cogitations
(as I have sufficientlie prooved) then would I weet of our witch-
mongers the reason, (if I read the conjuration and performe the
ceremonie) why the divell will not come at my call .-' But oh absurd
credulitie ! Even in this point manie wise & learned men have

dulie expend the cause, they might be soone resolved; specially when
the whole art and circumstance is so contrarie to Gods word, as it
must be false, if the other be true. So as you may understand, that
the papists do not onlie by their doctrine, in bookes & sermons teach
& publish conjurations, & the order thereof, whereby they may induce
men to bestowe, or rather cast awaie their monie upon masses
and suffrages for their soules ; but they make it also a par-
cell of their sacrament of orders (of the which number
a conjuror is one) and insert manie formes of

The rules and laiues of popish Exorcists and other conjurors all
one, with a confutation of their whole power, how S. Marline
conjured the divell




HE papists you see, have their certeine generall rules and Papists and

, , . - . , - , conjurors

lawes, as to absteine from sinne, and to fast, as also cousening
otherwise to be cleane from all pollusions, &c : and even compeers.
so likewise have the other conjurors. Some will saie
that papists use divine service, and praiers ; even so doo common
conjurors (as you see) even in the same papisticall forme, no whit
swarving from theirs in faith and doctrine, nor yet in ungodlie and
unreasonable kinds of petitions. Me thinks it may be a sufficient
argument, to overthrow the calling up and miraculous works of spirits,
that it is written ; God onelie knoweth and searcheth the harts, and i.Sam. i6, 7.
onelie worketh great woonders. The which argument being prose- jere^^ 17, 10!
cuted to the end, can never be answered : insomuch as that divine ^^\ '•'^' ^i'

. . Psal. 72, 18.

power is required m that action.

And if it be said, that in this conjuration we speake to the spirits,
and they heare us, & therefore need not know our thoughts and
imaginations : I first aske them whether king Baell, or Amoinion,
which are spirits reigning in the furthest regions of the east (as they
saie) may heare a conjurors voice, which calleth for them, being in
the extreamest parts of the west, there being such noises interposed,
where perhaps also they may be busie, and set to worke on the like
affaires. Secondlie, whether those spirits be of the same power that
God is, who is everiewhere, filling all places, and able to heare all
men at one instant, &c. Thirdlie, whence commeth the force of such
words as raise the dead, and command divels. If sound doo it, then
may it be doone by a taber and a pipe, or any other instrument that
hath no life. If the voice doo it, then may it be doone by any beasts
or birds. If words, then a parret may doo it. If in mans words
onhe, where is the force, in the first, second, or third syllable 1 If 448.
in syllables, then not in words. If in imaginations, then the divell
knoweth our thoughts. But all this stuffe is vaine and fabulous.

objection of witchmongers .^ They would needs take upon them to
conjure divels out of the pos.sessed. But what brought they to passe?
Yet that was in the time, whilest God suffered miracles commonlie to
be wrought. By that you may see what conjurors can doo.

Where is such a promise to conjurors or witches, as is made in the
Gospell to the faithfull.? where it is written ; In my name they shall
cast out divels, speake with new toongs : if they shall drinke any
deadlie thing, it shall not hurt them ; they shall take awaie serpents,
they shall laie hands on the sicke, and they shall recover. According
to the promise, this grant of miraculous working was performed in
the primitive church, for the confirmation of Christs doctrine, and
the establishing of the Gospell.

But as in another place I have prooved, the gift thereof was but
for a time, and is now ceased ; neither was it ever made to papist,
witch, or conjuror. They take upon them to call up and cast out
divels ; and to undoo with one divell, that which another divell hath
doone. If one divell could cast out another, it were a kingdome
divided, and could not stand. Which argument Christ himselfe
maketh : and therfore I maie the more boldlie saie even with Christ,
that they have no such power. For ^besides him, there is no saviour,
'' none can deliver out of his hand. Who but hee can declare, set in
order, appoint, and tell what is to come.-' He destroieth the tokens
of soothsaiers, and maketh the conjecturers fooles, &c. He declareth
things to come, and so cannot witches.

There is no helpe in inchanters and soothsaiers, and other such
vaine sciences. For divels are cast out by the finger of God, which
Matthew calleth the spirit of God, which is the mightie power of
God, and not by the vertue of the bare name onelie, being spoken
or pronounced : for then might everie wicked man doo it. And
Simon Magiis needed not then to have proffered monie to have
bought the power to doo miracles and woonders : for he could
speake and pronounce the name of God, as well as the apostles. In-
deed they maie soone throwe out all the divels that are in frankin-
cense, and such like creatures, wherein no divels are : but neither
they, nor all their holie water can indeed cure a man possessed with
a divell, either in bodie or mind ; as Christ did. Naie, why doo they
not cast out the divell that possesseth their owne soules ?

Let me heare anie of them' all speake with new toongs, let them
drinke but one dramme of a potion which I will prepare for them, let
them cure the sicke by laieng on of hands (though witches take it
upon them, and witchmongers beleeve it) and then I will subscribe
unto them. But if they, which repose such certeintie in the actions
of witches and conjurors, would diligentlie note their deceipt, and



of Witchcraft.

how the scope whereat they shoote is monie (I meane not such
witches as are falsehe accused, but such as take upon them to give
answers, &c : as mother Bttngie did) they should apparenthe see the
cousenage. For they are abused, as are manie beholders of jugglers,
which suppose they doo miraculouslie, that which is doone by slight
and subtiltie.

But in this matter of witchcrafts and conjurations, if men would
rather trust their owne eies, than old wives tales and lies, I dare
undertake this matter would soone be at a perfect point ; as being
easier to be perceived than juggling. But I must needs confesse,
that it is no great marvell, though the simple be abused therein, when
such lies concerning those matters are mainteined by such persons of
account, and thrust into their divine service. As for example : It is
written that S. Maftine thrust his fingers into ones mouth that had a
divell within him, and used to bite folke ; and then did bid him
devoure them if he could. And bicause the divell could not get out
at his mouth, being stopt with S. Mariins fingers, he was faine to
run out at his fundament. O stinking lie !

Tiat it is a shame for papists to beleeve other conjurors dooifigs,
their ozvne being of so title force, Hipocrates his opinion
herein.

ND still me thinks papists (of all others) which indeed
are most credulous, and doo most mainteine the force of
witches charmes, and of conjurors cousenages, should
perceive and judge conjurors dooings to be void of effect.
For when they see their owne stuffe, as holie water, salt, candles, &c:
conjured by their holie bishop and preests ; & that in the words of
consecration or conjuration (for so* their owne doctors terme them)
they adjure the water, &c : to heale, not onelie the soules infirmitie,
but also everie maladie, hurt, or ach of the bodie ; and doo also com-
mand the candles, with the force of all their authoritie and power,
and by the effect of all their holie words, not to consume : and yet
neither soule nor bodie anie thing recover, nor the candles last one
minute the longer : with what face can they defend the others mira-
culous workes ; as though the witches and conjurors actions were
more effectuall than their owne .'' Hippocrates being but a heathen,
and not having the perfect knowledge of God, could see and perceive

boast so, that they can remoove or helpe the infections of diseases, with
sacrifices, conjurations, or other magicall instruments or meanes, are
but needie fellowes, wanting living ; and therefore referre their words
to the divell : bicause they would seeme to know somewhat more
than the common people. It is marvell that papists doo afifirme, that
their holie water, crosses, or bugges words have such vertue and
violence, as to drive awaie divels : so as they dare not approch to
anie place or person besmeered with such stuffe ; when as it appeareth
in the gospell, that the divell presumed to assault and tempt Christ
himselfe. For the divell indeed most ernestlie busieth himselfe

How conjurors have beguiled witches, what bookes they carie
about to procure credit to their art, wicked assertions against
Moses and Joseph.

HUS you see that conjurors are no small fooles. For
whereas witches being poore and needie, go from doore
to doore for releefe, have they never so manie todes or
cats at home, or never so much hogs doong and charvill*
about them, or never so manie charmes in store : these conjurors (I
saie) have gotten them offices in the church of Rome., wherby they
have obteined authoritie & great estimation. And further, to adde
credit to that art, these conjurors carrie about at this dale, bookes
intituled under the names of Adain, Abet, Tobie, & Enoch ; which
Enoch they repute the most divine fellow in such matters. They
have also among them bookes that they saie Abraham, Aaron and
Salomon made. Item they have bookes of Zacharie, Paule, Honorius,
Cyprian, Jerome, Jeremie, Albert, and Thomas : also of the angels,
Riziel, Razael, and Raphael; and these doubtlesse were such bookes
as were said to have beene burnt in the lesser Asia. And for their
further credit they boast, that they must be and are skilfull and learned
in these arts ; to wit, Ars Abnadell, ars Notoria, ars Bulaphics, ars
Arthephii, ars Poinena,\ ars Revelationis, &^c. Yea, these conjurors
in corners sticke not (with yj;^) to report and affirme, tha.t Joseph,
who was a true figure of Christ that delivered and redeemed us, was

learned in these arts, and thereby prophesied and expounded dreames:
and that those arts came from him to Moses, and finallie from Moses
to them : which thing both Plitiie and Tacitus affirme of Moses. Also PUn. lib. 30.
Sirabo in his cosmographie maketh the verie like blasphemous strkb-lib. 16
report. And likewise Apollonuis,\ Molon, Possidomics, Lisiinachtts, 452.
and Appiaii terme Moses both a magician and a conjuror : whom
Eusebitis confuteth with manie notable arguments. For Moses
differed as much from a magician, as truth from falshood, and pietie
from vanitie : for in truth, he confounded all magicke, and made the
world see, and the cunningest magicians of the earth confesse, that
their owne dooings were but illusions, and that his miracles were
wrought by the finger of God. But that the poore old witches know-
ledge reacheth thus farre (as Danceus affirmeth it dooth) is untrue :
for their furthest fetches that I can comprehend, are but to fetch a
pot of milke, &c : from their neighbors house, halfe a mile distant
from them.

All inagicall arts confided by an argument concertiing Nero,
what Cornelius Agrippa and Carolus Callus have left written

thereof, and prooved by experience.

URELIE Nero prooved all these magicall arts to be
vaine and fabulous lies, and nothing but cousenage and
knaverie. He was a notable prince, having gifts of
nature enow to have conceived such matters, treasure
enough to have emploied in the search thereof, he made no conscience
therein, he had singular conferences thereabout ; he offered, and
would have given halfe his kingdome to have learned those things,
which he heard might be wrought by magicians ; he procured all
the cunning magicians in the world to come to Rome, he searched
for bookes also, and all other things necessarie for a magician ; and
never could find anie thing in it, but cousenage and legierdemaine.
At length he met with one Tiridates, the great magician, who having
with him all his companions, and fellowe magicians, witches, con-
jurors, and couseners, invited Nero to certeine magicall bankets and
exercises. Which when Nero required to learne, he (to hide his _^rj.
cousenage) answered that he would not, nor could not teach him,
though he would have given him his kingdome. The matter of his
refusall (I saie) was, least Nero should espie the cousening devises
thereof. Which when Nero conceived, and sawe the same, and all

the residue of that art to be vaine, lieng and ridiculous, having onelie
shadowes of truth, and that their arts were onehe veneficall ; he pro-
hibited the same utterlie, and made good and strong lawes against
the use and the practisers thereof : as Fliiiie and others doo report. It
is marvell that anie man can be so much abused, as to suppose that
sathan may be commanded, compelled, or tied by the power of man :
as though the divell would yeeld to man, beyond nature ; that will
not yeeld to God his creator, according to the rules of nature. And
in so much as there be (as they confesse) good angels as well as bad ;
I would know whie they call up the angels of hell, and not calldowne
the angels of heaven. But this they answer (as Agrippa saith.)
Good angels (forsooth) doo hardlie appeare, and the other are readie
at hand. Here I may not omit to tell you how Cor. Agrippa be-
wraieth, detecteth, and defaceth this art of conjuration, who in his
youth travelled into the bottome of all these magicall sciences, and
was not onelie a great conjuror and practiser thereof, but also wrote
cunninglie De occulta philosopJiia. Howbeit, afterwards in his wiser
age, he recanteth his opinions, and lamenteth his follies in that be-
halfe, and discovereth the impietie and vanities of magicians, and
inchanters, which boast they can doo miracles : which action is now
ceased (saith he) and assigneth them a place \V\\!a.Jannes ?in6. Jambres,
affirming that this art teacheth nothing but vaine toies for a shew.
Carolus Callus also saith ; I have tried oftentimes, by the witches
and conjurors themselves, that their arts (especiallie those which doo
328. consist of charmes, impossibilities, conjurations, and witchcrafts^
whereof they were woont to boast) to be meere foolishnes, doting lies,
and dreames. I for my part can saie as much, but that I delight not
to alledge mine owne proofes and authorities ; for that mine adver-
saries will saie they are parciall, and not indifferent.

ing ; which Polydore Virgil., and manie other repeat verbatim, in this

of Witchcraft. chap. n-



o"j



Salomon was the greatest philosopher, and did philosophic about
all things, and had the full and perfect knowlege of all their pro-
prieties : but he had that gift given from above to him, for the profit
and health of mankind : which is efifectuall against divels. He made
also inchantments, wherewith diseases are driven awaie ; and left
diverse maners of conjurations written, whereunto the divels giving
place are so driven awaie, that they never returne. And this kind of
healing is very common among my countrimen : for I sawe a neigh-
bour of mine, one Eleazer, that in the presence of Vespasian and his Probatum
sonnes, and the rest of the souldiers, cured many that were possessed «upona
with spirits. The maner and order of his cure was this. He did forewitnps:
put unto the nose of the possessed a ring, under the scale wherof was ^''^° "° ''^'
inclosed a kind of roote, whose verture Salomon declared, and the
savour thereof drewe the divell out at his nose ; so as downe fell the
man, and then Eleazer conjured the divell to depart, & to return no
more to him. In the meane time he made mention of Salomon,
reciting incantations of Salomons owne making. And then Eleazer
being willing to shew the slanders by his cunning, and the wonderful!
efificacie of his art, did set not farre from thence, a pot or basen full
of water, & commanded the divell that went out of the man, that by
the overthrowing thereof, he would give a signe to the beholders, that
he had utterlie forsaken and leaft the man. Which thing being doone, 4S5-
none there doubted how great Salomons knowledge and wisedome
was. Wherin a jugling knacke was produced, to confirme a cogging
cast of knaverie or cousenage.

Another storie of Salomons conjuration I find cited in the sixt
lesson, read in the church of Rome upon S. Margarets daie, far more
ridiculous than this. Also Peter Lombard rmSsi&r of the sentences, ... ,.,

Lib. 4 dist. 14.

and Gratian his brother, the compiler of the golden decrees ; and Dccret. au-
Dirandus in h.\s Rationale divinorum., doo all soberlie affirme Salomons '^"I'^'ae'tx-'
cunning in this behalfe ; and speciallie this tale ; to wit, that Salomon oms.
inclosed certeine thousand divels in a brasen bowle, and left it in a 329.
deepe hole or lake, so as afterwards the Babylonians found it, and
supposing there had beene gold or silver therein, brake it, and out flew
all the divels, &c. And that this fable is of credit, you shall perceive,
in that it is thought woorthie to be read in the Romish church as par-
cell of their divine service. Looke in the lessons of S. Margarets ^_.^^ ^ ^^ g
daie the virgine, and you shall find these words verbatim : which I
the rather recite, bicause it serveth me for divers turnes ; to wit, for
Salomons conjurations, for the tale of the brasen vessell, and for the
popes conjurations, which extended both to faith and doctrine, and to
shew of what credit their religion is, that so shamefullie is stained
with lies and fables.

Lessons read in all churches, ivJiere the pope hath authorities
on S. Margarets dale, tra?islated into English word for
word.

JOLIE Margaret required of GOD, that she might have
a conflict face to face with hir secret enimie the divell ;
and rising from praier, she sawe a terrible dragon, that
would have devoured hir, but she made the signe of the
crosse, and the dragon burst in the middest.

Afterwards, she sawe another man sitting like a Niger, having his
hands bound fast to his knees, she taking him by the haire of the head,
threw him to the ground, and set hir foote on his head ; and hir
praiers being made, a light shined from heaven into the prison where
she was, and the crosse of Christ was seene in heaven, with a doove
sitting thereon, who said ; Blessed art thou O Margaret, the gates of
paradise attend thy comming. Then she giving thanks to God, said
to the divell. Declare to me thy name. The divell said ; Take awaie
thy foote from my head, that I may be able to speake, and tell thee :
which being done, the divell said, I am Veltis, one of them whome
Salomon shut in the brasen vessell, and the Babylotiians comming,
and supposing there had beene gold therein, brake the vessell, and
then we flew out : ever since lieng in wait to annoie the just. But
seeing I have recited a part of hir storie, you shall also have the
end therof : for at the time of hir execution this was hir praier
following.

Grant therefore O father, that whosoever writeth, readeth, or heareth
my passion, or maketh memoriall of me, may deserve pardon for all his
sinnes : whosoever calleth on me, being at the point of death, deliver
him out of the hands of his adversaries. And I also require, O Lord,
that whosoever shall build a church in the honor of me, or ministreth
unto me anie candles* of his just labour, let him obteine whatsoever
he asketh for his health. Deliver all women in travell that call upon
me, from the danger thereof.

Hir praier ended, there were manie great thunderclaps, and a doove
came downe from heaven, saieng ; Blessed art thou O Margaret the
spouse of Christ. Such things as thou hast asked, are granted unto thee;
therefore come thou into everlasting rest, &c. Then the hangman
(though she did bid him) refused to cut off hir head : to whome she
said ; Except thou doo it, thou canst have no part with me, and then
lo he did it, &c. But sithens I have beene, and must be tedious, I

thought good to refresh my reader with a lamentable storie, depend-

for word, in maner and forme following. 

The XXXV. Chapter. 457-

A delicate storie of a Lombard.^ wJio by S. Margarets example
would needs fight with a reall divell.

HERE was (after a sermon made, wherein this storie of
S. Margaret was recited, for in such stufife consisted
not onelie their service, but also their sermons in the
blind time of poperie :) there was (I saie) a certeine
yoong man, being a Lombard, whose simplicitie was such, as he
had no respect unto the commoditie of worldlie things, but did
altogither affect the salvation of his soule, who hearing how great
S. Margarets triumph was, began to consider with himselfe, how Kakozdia.
full of slights the divell was. And among other things thus he
said ; Oh that God would suffer, that the divell might fight with me
hand to hand in visible forme ! I would then surelie in like maner
overthrow him, and would fight with him till I had the victorie. And
therefore about the twelfe houre he went out of the towne, and finding
a convenient place where to praie, secretlie kneeling on his knees, he
praied among other things, that God would suffer the divell to appeare
unto him in visible forme, that according to the example of S.
Margaret., he might overcome him in battell. And as he was in the
middest of his praiers, there came into that place a woman with a
hooke in hir hand, to gather certeine hearbs which grew there, who
was dumme borne. And when she came into the place, and saw the Mutuaii
yoong man among the hearbs on his knees, she was afraid, and waxed ^e°ne
pale, and going backe, she rored in such sort, as hir voice could not of sudden
be understood, and with hir head and fists made threatning signes
unto him. The yoong man seeing such an ilfavoured fowle queane,
that was for age decrepit and full of wrinkles, with a long bodie,
leane of face, pale of colour, with ragged cloathes, crieng verie lowd,
and having a voice not understandable, threatning him with the
hooke which she carried in hir hand, he thought surelie she had
beene no woman, but a divell appearing unto him in the shape of a 4^S.
woman, and thought God had heard his praiers. For the which
causes he fell upon hir lustilie, and at length threw hir downe to the
ground, saieng ; Art thou come thou curssed divell, art thou come ?
No no, thou shalt not overthrow me in visible fight, whomc ihou
hast often overcome in invisible temptation.

And as he spake these words, he caught hir by the haire, and drew
hir about, beating hir sometimes with his hands, sometimes with his

bodie that seemed dead to be brought unto him, and thereupon
(according to his maner) he laid his hand upon hir, who immediatlie
revived, and he called one of his chaplines to heare hir confession.
But they that were present said to the man of God, that it were
altogether in vaine so to doo, for that she had beene from hir
nativitie dumbe, and could neither heare nor understand the priest,
neither could in words confesse hir sinnes. Notwithstanding, S.
Vincent bad the priest heare hir confession, affirming that she should

ever the man of God commanded, the priest did confidentlie
accomplish and obeie : and as soone as the priest approched unto
hir, to heare hir confession, she, whome all Cathalonia knew to be
dumbe borne, spake, and confessed hir selfe, pronouncing everie
word as distinctlie, as though she had never beene dumbe. After hir
confession she required the eucharist and extreame unction to be
ministred unto hir, and at length she commended hir selfe to God ;
and in the presence of all that came to see that miracle, she spake as
long as she had anie breath in hir bodie. The yoong man that killed
hir being saved from the gallowes by S. Vincents meanes, and at his
intercession, departed home into Italie. This storie last rehearsed
is found in Specula exeviploriim, and repeated also by Robert
Carocul : bishop of Aquinas, and manie others, and preached
publikelie in the church of Rome.\

ridiculous circumstance thereof. Though it were cruellie

could not speake so long as she troad on his head, and yet he said ;
Tread off, that I may tell you what I am. She sawe the heavens open
and yet she was in a close prison. But hir sight was verie cleare
that could see a little dove sitting upon a crosse so farre off. For
heaven is higher than the sunne; and the sunne, when it is neerest
to us, is 3966000. miles from us. And she had a good paire of eares,
that could heare a dove speake so farre off. And she had good lucke,
that S. Peter, who (they saie) is porter, or else the pope, who hath
more dooings than Peter, had such leisure as to staie the gates so
long for hir. Salomofi provided no good place, neither tooke good
order with his brasen bowle. I marvell how they escaped that let out
the divels. It is marvell also they melted it not with their breath
long before : for the divels carrie hell and hell fier about with them
alwaies ; in so much as (they saie) they leave ashes evermore where
they stand. Surelie she made in hir praier an unreasonable request.
But the date of hir patent is out : for I beleeve that whosoever at this
dale shall burne a poundof good candle before hir, shall be never the
better, but three pence the worsse. But now we may find in S. Mar-
garets life, who it is that is Christes wife : whereby we are so inuch
wiser than we were before. But looke in the life of S. Katharine,
in the golden legend, and you shall find that he was also married
to S. Katharine, and that our ladie made the marriage, &c. An
excellent authontie forbigamie. Here I will also cite other of their
notable stories, or miracles of authoritie, and so leave shaming of
them, or rather troubling you the readers thereof. Neither would
I have written these fables, but that they are authentike among the
papists, and that we that are protestants may be satisfied, as well
of conjurors and witches miracles, as of the others : for the one is
as grosse as the other.

and said in the hearing of all that were present : I conjure thee O
divell, by him, whom I carrie in my hands, that thou exercise not these
great visions and phantasies by these men, to the drowning of this

crament touched the element, the phantasie gave place to the veritie ;
and they being prooved and made false, did sinke like lead to the

was verie glad of the miracle, but for the losse of the sacrament he
was verie pensive, passing awaie the whole night in teares and
moorning : in the morning he found the pix with the sacrament upon

How would he have plagued the divell, that threw his

no more power to destroie the Waldettses with sword and

But I may not omit one fable, which is of authoritie, wherein though

there be no conjuration expressed, yet I warrant you there was

cousenage both in the doomg and telling thereof. i^= You shall

read in the lesson on saint Lucies daie, that she being condemned,

could not be remooved from the place with a teeme of oxen, neither

0visioiis, noises, appat'itiotis, and iinagitied sounds, and 0 ciher
illusions, of wanderitig sotiles : luith a confutation the^-eof

AN IE thorough melanchohe doo imagine, that they see
or heare visions, spirits, ghosts, strange noises, &c : as
I have aheadie prooved before, at large. Manie againe
thorough feare proceeding from a cowardlie nature and
complexion, or from an effeminate and fond bringing up, are timerous
and afraid of spirits, and bugs, &c. Some through imperfection of
sight also are afraid of their owne shadowes, and (as Aristotle saith)
see themselves sometimes as it were in a glasse. And some through
weakenesse of bodie have such unperfect imaginations. Droonken
men also sometimes suppose they see trees waike, &c : according to
that which Salomon saith to the droonkards ; Thine eies shall see
strange visions, and mervellous appearances.

In all ages moonks and preests have abused and bewitched the
world with counterfet visions ; which proceeded through idlenes, and
restraint of marriage, wherby they grew hot and lecherous, and
therefore devised such meanes to compasse and obteine their loves.
And the simple people being then so superstitious, would never
seeme to mistrust, that such holie men would make them cuckholds,
but forsooke their beds in that case, and gave roome to the cleargie.
Item, little children have beene so scared with their mothers maids,
that they could never after endure to be in the darke alone, for feare
of bugs. Manie are deceived by glasses through art perspective.
Manie hearkening unto false reports, conceive and beleeve that which
is nothing so. Manie give credit to that which they read in authors.
But how manie stories and bookes are written of walking spirits apd
soules of men, contrarie to the word of God ; a reasonable volume
cannot conteine. How common an opinion was it among the papists,
that all soules walked on the ear^^ , after they departed from their
bodies t In so much as it was in .ile time of poperie a usuall matter,
to desire sicke people in their death beds, to appeare to them after
their death, and to reveale their estate. The fathers and ancient
doctors of the church were too credulous herein, &c. Therefore no
mervell, though the common simple sort of men, and least of all,
that women be deceived herein. God in times past did send downe
visible angels and appearances to men ; but now he dooth not so.
Through ignorance of late in religion, it was thought, that everie

churchyard swarmed with soules and spirits : but now the word ol
God being more free, open, and knovvne, those conceipts and illusions
are made more manifest and apparent, &c.

The doctors, councels, and popes, which (they saie) cannot erre,
46^. have confirmed the walking, appearing, & raising of soules. But
where find they in the scriptures anie such doctrine ? And who
certified them, that those appearances were true ? Trulie all they
cannot bring to passe, that the lies which have beene spread abroad
herein, should now beginne to be true, though the pope himselfe
subscribe, scale, and sweare thereunto never so much. Where are
the soules that swarmed in times past ? Where are the spirits ?
Who heareth their noises ? Who seeth their visions .'' Where are
the soules that made such mone for trentals, whereby to be eased of
the paines in purgatorie ? Are they all gone into Italie, bicause
masses are growne deere here in Englandl Marke well this illusion,
and see how contrarie it is unto the word of God. Consider how all
papists beleeve this illusion to be true, and how all protestants are
driven to saie it is and was popish illusion. Where be the spirits
that wandered to have buriall for their bodies ? For manie of those
walking soules went about that busines. Doo you not thinke, that
the papists shew not themselves godlie divines, to preach and teach
the people such doctrine; and to insert into their divine service such
fables as are read in the Romish church, all scripture giving place
thereto for the time ? You shall see in the lessons read there upon
S. Steveiis dale, that Gamaliel Nichodenitis his kinsman, and Abdias
his Sonne, with his freend S. Steven, appeared to a certeine preest,
called Sir Lncian, requesting him to remove their bodies, and to
burie them in some better place (for they had lien from the time of
their death, untill then, being in the reigne of Hotiorius the emperor;
to wit, foure hundred yeeres buried in the field of Gamaliel, who in
that respect said to Sir Lucian ; Non met solummodo causa solicitus
sum, sed potius pro illis qui mecum. sunt ; that is, I am not onlie
carefull for my selfe, but cheefelie for those my friends that are with
me. Whereby the whole course may be perceived to be a false
practise, and a counterfet vision, or rather a lewd invention. For in
heaven mens soules remaine not in sorow and care ; neither studie
335. they there how to compasse and get a worshipful! buriall here in
earth. If they did, they would not have foreslowed it so long. Now
therefore let us not suffer our selves to be abused anie longer, either
with conjuring preests, or melancholicall witches ; but be

such blindnes and
error.

Cardanns opinion of strange noises, Jio%v counterfct visions grow
to be credited, of popish appeerances, of pope Boniface.

ARDANUS speaking of noises, among other things,
saith thus ; A noise is heard in your house ; it may be a
mouse, a cat, or a dog among dishes ; it may be a coun-
terfet or a theefe indeed, or the fault may be in your
eares. I could recite a great number of tales, how men have even
forsaken their houses, bicause of such apparitions and noises : and
all hath beene by meere and ranke knaverie. And wheresoever you
shall heare, that there is in the night season such rumbling and
fearefiill noises, be you well assured that it is flat knaverie, performed
by some that seemeth most to complaine, and is least mistrusted.
And hereof there is a verie art, which for some respects I will not
discover. The divell seeketh dailie as well as nightlie whome he
may devoure, and can doo his feats as well by dale as by night, or
else he is a yoong divell, and a verie bungler. But of all other
couseners, these conjurors are in the highest degree, and are most
worthie of death for their blasphemous impietie. But that these
popish visions and conjurations used as well by papists, as by the
popes themselves, were meere cousenages ; and that the tales of the
popes recited by Bruno and Platina, of their magicall devises, were
but plaine cousenages and knaveries, may appeare by the historie of
Bonifacius the eight, who used this kind of inchantment, to get away
the popedome from his predecessor Ccelestitius. He counterfetted a
voice through a cane reed, as though it had come from heaven, per-
suading him to yeeld up his authoritie of popeship, and to institute
therein one Bonifacius, a worthier man : otherwise he threatened
him with damnation. And therfore the foole yeelded it up accord-
inglie, to the said Bonifacius, An. 1264. of whom it was said ; He
came in like a fox, lived like a woolfe, and died like a dog.

There be innumerable examples of such visions, which when they

are not detected, go for true stories : and therefore when it is

answered that some are true tales and some are false, untill they be

able to shew foorth before your eies one matter of truth, you

may replie upon them with this distinction ;

to wit : visions tried are false

visions, undecided and

untried are

true.

Of the noise or sotaid 0 eccho, 0 one thai nM-rowlie escaped
drowning thereby., &'c.

fLAS ! how manie naturall things are there so strange, as
to manie seeme miraculous ; and how manie counterfet
matters are there, that to the simple seeme yet more
wonderfull ? Cardane telleth of one Cornensis,vi\\o comming
rivers side, not knowing where to passe over, cried out
alowd for some bodie to shew him the foord : who hearing an eccho
to answer according to his last word, supposing it to be a man that
answered him and informed him of the waie, he passed through the
river, even there where was a deepe whirlepoole, so as he hardlie
escaped with his life ; and told his freends, that the divell had almost
persuaded him to drowne himselfe. And in some places these noises
of eccho are farre more strange than other, speciallie at Ticitiittn in
Italie, in the great hall, where it rendereth sundrie and manifold
noises or voices, which seeme to end so lamentablie, as it were a man
that laie a dieng ; so as few can be persuaded that it is the eccho, but
a spirit that answereth.

The noise at Winchester was said to be a verie miracle, and much
wondering was there at it, about the yeare 1569. though indeed a
meere naturall noise ingendered of the wind, the concavitie of
the place, and other instrumentall matters helping the sound to
seeme strange to the hearers ; speciallie to such as would adde new
reports to the augmentation of the woonder.

HERE is yet another art professed by these cousening

honest and lawfull than necromancie, which is called

Theurgie ; wherein they worke by good angels. How-

beit, their ceremonies are altogether papisticall and superstitious,

consisting in cleanlines partlie of the mind, partlie of the bodie, and

partlie of things about and belonging to the bodie ; as in the skinne,

in the apparell, in the house, in the vessell and houshold stuffe, in

oblations and sacrifices ; the cleanlines whereof, they saie, dooth
dispose men to the contemplation of heavenlie things. They cite
these words of Esaie for their authoritie ; to wit : Wash your selves
and be cleane, &c. In so much as I have knowne diverse supersti-
tious persons of good account, which usuallie washed all their
apparell upon conceits ridiculouslie. For uncleanlinesse (they say)
corrupteth the aire, infecteth man, and chaseth awaie cleane spirits. 337.
Hereunto belongeth the art of Alinadel, the art of Paiile^ the art Appen-
of Revelations, and the art Notarie. But (as A^rippa saith) the ^ the sup-
more divine these arts seeme to the ignorant, the more damnable v°n'^art''
they be. But their false assertions, their presumptions to worke ofThsur-
miracles, their characters, their strange names, their diffuse phrases, ^'^'
their counterfet holines, their popish ceremonies, their foolish
words mingled with impietie, their barbarous and unlearned
order of construction, their shameles practises, their paltrie stufFe,
their secret dealing, their beggerlie life, their bargaining with
fooles, their cousening of the simple, their scope and drift for
monie dooth bewraie all their art to be counterfet cousenage.
And the more throughlie to satisfie you herein, I thought good in
this place to insert a letter, upon occasion sent unto me, by one
which at this present time lieth as a prisoner condemned for this
verie matter in the kings bench, and reprived by hir majesties mercie, 46J.

A conclusion, in inaner of an epilogs repeatifig inaiiie of the former
absurdities of ivitcJwiongers conceipts, confutations thereof and
of the authoritie of fames Sprefiger and Henrie histitor in-
quisitors and compilers of M. Mai.

ITHERTO you have had delivered unto you, that which
I have conceived and gathered of this matter. In the
substance and principall parts vi'herof I can see no
difference among the writers heereupon ; of what coun-
trie, condition, estate, or religion so ever they be ; but I find almost
all of them to agree in unconstancie, fables, and impossibilities ;
scratching out of M. Mai. the substance of all their arguments : so
as their authors being disapproved, they must coine new stuffe, or go
to their grandams maids to learne more old wives tales, whereof this
art of witchcraft is contrived. But you must know that fames
Sprenger, and Henrie Institor, whome I have had occasion to alledge
manie times, were coparteners in the composition of that profound
& learned booke called Malleus Ufalefcarum, & were the greatest
doctors of that art : out of whom I have gathered matter and absur-
ditie enough, to confound the opinions conceived of witchcraft ;
although they were allowed inquisitors and assigned by the pope,
with the authoritie and commendation of all the doctors of the
universitie of Collen, &c : to call before them, to imprison, to con-
demne, and to execute witches ; and finallie to seaze and confiscate
their goods.

These two doctors, to mainteine their their* credit, and to cover their
injuries, have published those same monsterous lies, which have
abused all Christendome, being spread abroad with such authoritie,
as it will be hard to suppresse the credit of their writings, be they
never so ridiculous and false. Which although they mainteine and
stirre up with their owne praises ; yet men are so bewitched, as to
give credit unto them. For proofe whereof I remember they write in
one place of their said booke, that by reason of their severe pro-
ceedings against witches, they suffered intollerable assaults, speciallie
in the night, many times finding needdels sticking in their biggens,

which were thither conveied by witches charmes : and through their them over

that might make to the manifestation of their holines : for then should
their owne praise stinke in their owne mouthes. And yet God knoweth

The second Chapter.




By luhat nieanes the commoti people have beetle made beleeve in
the miraculous works of witches, a defitiition of witchcraft,
and a description thereof.

HE common people have beene so assotted and bewitched,
with whatsoever poets have feigned of witchcraft, either
in earnest, in jest, or else in derision ; and with whatso-
ever lowd Hers and couseners for their pleasures heerein
have invented, and with whatsoever tales they have heard from old
doting women, or from their mothers maids, and with whatsoever the
grandfoole their ghostlie father, or anie other morrow masse preest
had informed them ; and finallie with whatsoever they have swallowed
up through tract of time, or through their owne timerous nature or
ignorant conceipt, concerning these matters of hagges and witches :
as they have so settled their opinion and credit thereupon, that they
thinke it heresie to doubt in anie part of the matter ; speciallie
bicause they find this word witchcraft expressed in the scriptures ;
which is as to defend praieng to saincts, bicause Sanctus, Sanctus,
Sanctus is written in Te Deum.

And now to come to the definition of witchcraft, which hitherto I
did deferre and put off purposelie : that you might perceive the true
nature thereof, by the circumstances, and therefore the rather to allow
of the same, seeing the varietie of other writers. Witchcraft is in
truth a cousening art, wherin the name of God is abused, prophaned
and blasphemed, and his power attributed to a vile creature. In
estimation of the vulgar people, it is a supernaturall worke, contrived
betweene a corporall old woman, and a spirituall divell. The maner
thereof is so secret, mysticall, and strange, that to this daie there hath
never beene any credible witnes therof It is incomprehensible to
the wise, learned or faithful! ; a probable matter to children, fooles.

&c : the which words although any other creature doo pronounce, in

or usuall for that action : yet none is said to have the grace or gift to
performe the matter, except she be a witch, and so taken, either by

Reasons to proove that words and characters are but babies, (S^'
that witches canfiot doo such things as the multitude supposeth
they can, their greatest woonders prooved trifles, of a yoong
gentleman couse7ied.

HAT words, characters, images, and such other trinkets,
which are thought so necessarie instruments for witch-
craft (as without the which no such thing can be
accomplished) are but babies, devised by couseners, to
abuse the people withal) ; I trust I have sufficientlie prooved. And
the same maie be further and more plainelie perceived by these short
and compendious reasons following.

First, in that the Turkes and infidels, in their witchcraft, use both
other words, and other characters than our witches doo, and also such
as are most contrarie. In so much as, if ours be bad, in reason theirs
should be good. If their witches can doo anie thing, ours can doo
nothing. For as our witches are said to renounce Christ, and despise
his sacraments : so doo the other forsake Mahomet, and his lawes,
which is one large step to christianitie.

It is also to be thought, that all witches are couseners ; when
mother Bungie, a principall witch, so reputed, tried, and condemned
of all men, and continuing in that exercise and estimation manie
yeares (having cousened & abused the whole realme, in so much as
there came to hir, witchmongers from all the furthest parts of the
land, she being in diverse bookes set out with authoritie, registred and

among all men for the cheefe ringleader of all other witches) by good

freelie, without compulsion or inforcement, that hir cunning consisted

owne knowledge, and partlie by the testimonie of hir husband, and
others of credit, to whome (I saie) in hir death bed, and at sundrie
other times she protested these things ; and also that she never had
indeed anie materiall spirit or divell (as the voice went) nor yet knew
how to worke anie supernaturall matter, as she in hir life time made
men beleeve she had and could doo.

The like may be said of one T. of Cantierbttrie, whose name I will
not litterallie discover, who wonderfullie abused manie in these parts,
making them thinke he could tell where anie thing lost became : with
diverse other such practises, whereby his fame was farre beyond the
others. And yet on his death bed he confessed, that he knew nothing
more than anie other, but by slight and devises, without the assistance
of anie divell or spirit, saving the spirit of cousenage : and this did
he (I saie) protest before manie of great honestie, credit, & wisedome,
who can witnesse the same, and also gave him good commendations
for his godlie and honest end.

Againe, who will mainteine, that common witchcrafts are not
cousenages, when the great and famous witchcrafts, which had stolne
credit not onlie from all the common people, but from men of great
wisdome and authoritie, are discovered to be beggerlie slights of
cousening varlots ? Which otherwise might and would have remained Iv*^^ j. .

is manifested a traiterous heart to the Queene, and a presumption
against God.

But to returne to the discoverie of the aforesaid knaverie and
witchcraft. So it was that one old cousener, wanting monie, devised
or rather practised (for it is a stale devise) to supplie his want, by
promising a yoong Gentleman, whose humor he thought would that
waie be well served, that for the summe of fourtie pounds, he would
not faile by his cunning in that art of witchcraft, to procure unto him
the love of anie three women whome he would name, and of whome
he should make choise at his pleasure. The yoong Gentleman being
abused with his cunning devises, and too hastilie yeelding to that
motion, satisfied this cunning mans demand of monie. Which,
bicause he had it not presentlie to disbursse, provided it for him at
343. the hands of a freend of his. Finallie, this cunning man made the
three puppets of wax, &c : leaving nothing undone that appertained
to the cousenage, untill he had buried them, as you have heard. But
I omit to tell what a doo was made herof, and also what reports and
lies were bruted ; as what white dogs and blacke dogs there were
seene in the night season passing through the watch, mawgre all their
force and preparation against them, &c. But the yoong Gentleman,
who for a litle space remained in hope mixed with joy and love, now
through tract of time hath those his felicities powdered with doubt
and despaire. For in steed of atchieving his love, he would gladlie
have obteined his monie. But bicause he could by no meanes get
either the one or the other (his monie being in hucksters handling,
and his sute in no better forwardnes) he revealed the whole matter,
hoping by that meanes to recover his monie ; which he neither can
yet get againe, nor hath paied it where he borrowed. But till triall was
had of his simplicitie or rather follie herein, he received some trouble
himselfe hereabouts, though now dismissed.

that happened within the compasse of a childes remem-
brance, which may induce anie resonable bodie to
conceive, that these supernaturall actions are but fables
& cousenages. There was one, whom for some respects I name not.

that was taken blind, deafe, & dumbe ; so as no physician could
helpe him. That man (forsooth) though he was (as is said) both
blind, dumbe & deafe, yet could he read anie canonicall scriptures ;
but as for apocrypha, he could read none : wherein a Gods name
consisted the miracle. But a leafe of apocrypha being extraordinarilie There the
inserted among the canonicall scriptures, he read the same as was'ove*
authentike : wherein his knaverie was bewraied. Another had a "}(",<=^' f?""
divell, that answered men to all questions, marie hir divell could sembied
understand no Latine, and so was she (and by such meanes all the ^''^^'"*'
rest may be) bewraied. Indeed our witching writers saie, that
certeine divels speake onelie the language of that countrie where they
are resiant, as French, or English, &c.

Furthermore, in my conceipt, nothing prooveth more apparentlie
that witchcraft is cousenage, and that witches instruments are but
ridiculous babies, and altogither void of effect ; than when learned
and godlie divines, in their serious writings, produce experiments as
wrought by witches, and by divels at witches commandements : which
they expound by miracles, although indeed meere trifles. Whereof
they conceive amisse, being overtaken with credulitie.

wagge, and fall out of the fingers of them that hold it, and he
whose name remaineth in the keie must be the theefe. Hereupon
Heminghis inferreth, that although conjuring preests and witches
bring not this to passe by the absolute words of the psalme, which
tend to a farre other scope ; yet sathan dooth nimblie, with his in-
visible hand, give such a twitch to the booke, as also in the other
case to the sive and the sheeres, that downe falles the booke and keie,
sive and sheeres, up starts the theefe, and awaie runneth the divell
laughing, &c.

But alas, Hemingius is deceived, as not perceiving the conceipt, or
rather the deceipt hereof. For where he supposeth those actions to
be miraculous, and done by a divell ; they are in truth meere babies,
wherein consisteth not so much as legierdemaine. For everie carter
may conceive the slight hereof : bicause the booke and keie, sive and
sheeres, being staled up in that order, by naturall course, of necessitie
must within that space (by meanes of the aire, and the pulse beating
at the fingers end) turne and fall downe. Which experience being
knowne to the witch or conjuror, she or he doo forme and frame their
prophesie accordinglie : as whosoever maketh proofe thereof shall
manifestlie perceive it. By this art, practise, or experience, you shall
knowe what it is a clocke, if you hold betweene your finger and your
thumbe a thred of six or seven inches long, unto the other end whereof
is tied a gold ring, or some such like thing : in such sort as upon the
beating of your pulse, and the mooving of the ring, the same may
strike upon either side of a goblet or glasse. These things are (I
confesse) witchcraft, bicause the effect or event proceedeth not of
that cause which such couseners saie, and others beleeve they doo.
As when they laie a medicine for the ague, &c : to a childs wrists,
they also pronounce certeine words or charmes, by vertue whereof
(they saie) the child is healed : whereas indeed the medicine onelie
dooth the feate. And this is also a sillie jugglers knacke, which
wanteth legierdemaine, whom you shall see to thrust a pinne, or a
small knife, through the head and braine of a chicken or pullet, and
with certeine mysticall words seeme to cure him:* whereas, though no
such words were spoken, the chicken would live, and doo well enough ;
as experience teacheth and declareth.

Againe, when such as have mainteined the art and profession of
conjuring, and have written thereupon most cunninglie, have published
recantations, and confessed the deceipts thereof, as Cornelius Agrippa
did, whie should we defend it? Also, when heathen princes, of great
renowne, authoritie, & learning, have searched, with much industrie
and charge, the knowledge & secrecie of conjuration and witchcraft,
& finallie found by experience all to be false and vaine that is reported

of them, as Nero, Jtdiamis apostafa, and Valence did ; whie should
we seeke for further triall, to proove witchcraft and conjuration to be
cousenage ?

Also, when the miracles imputed unto them, exceed in quantitie,
qualitie and number, all the miracles that Christ wrought here upon
earth, for the establishing of his gospell, for the confirmation of our
faith, and for the advancement of his glorious name ; what good
christian will beleeve them to be true ? And when Christ himselfe
saith ; The works that I doo, no man else can accomplish ; whie
should we thinke that a foolish old woman can doo them all, and
mania more?

Also, when Christ knew not these witches, nor spake one word of
them in all the time of his being here upon earth, having such necessarie
occasion (if at leastwise they with their familiars could doo as he did
by the spirit of God, as is constantlie affirmed) whie should we sup-
pose that they can doo as they saie, but rather that they are de-
ceivers[?*] When they are faine to saie, that witches wrought not in that
art, all those thirtie three yeares that Christ lived, and that there were
none \n Jobs "iwv^^, and that the cousening oracles are now ceased ;
who seeth not that they are witlesse, and madde fooles that mainteine
it ? When all the mischeefes are accomplished by poisons and
naturall meanes, which they affirme to be brought to passe by words,
it manifesteth to the world their cousenage. When all the places of
scripture, which witchmongers allowe for the proofe of such witches,
are prooved to make nothing for their purpose, their own fables &
lies deserve small credit. When one of the cheefe points in con-
troversie ; to wit, execution of witches, is grounded upon a false
translation ; namelie. You shall not suffer a witch to live (which is
in Latine,t Veneficam non retmebitis in vita) where the word in
everie mans eare soundeth to be a poisoner, rather than a worker
of miracles, and so interpreted by the seventie 'm\.&x^x&X.ox%, Josephus
and almost of all the Rabbins, which were Hebrues borne : whie
should anie of their interpretations or allegations be trusted, or
well accounted of ? When working of miracles is ceased, and the
gift of prophesie also ; so as the godlie, through invocation of the
holie spirit, cannot performe such wonderfull things, as these
witches and conjurors by the invocation of divels and wicked
spirits undertake, and are said to doo ; what man that knoweth
and honoureth God will be so infatuate as to beleeve these lies,
and so preferre the power of witches and divels before the godlie
endued with Gods holie spirit ? When manie printed bookes are
published, even with authoritie, in confirmation of such miracles
wrought by those couseners, for the detection of witchcraft ;' and

in fine all is not onelie found false, and to have beene accomplished
by cousenage, but that there hath beene therein a set purpose to
defame honest matrones, as to make them be thought to be witches :
whie should we beleeve Bodin, M. Mai. &'c : in their cousening
tales and fables ? When they saie that witches can flie in the aire,
and come in at a little coane,* or a hole in a glasse windowe, and
steale awaie sucking children, and hurt their mothers ; and yet when
they are brought into prison, they cannot escape out of the grate,
which is farre bigger ; who will not condemne such accusations or
confessions to be frivolous, &c ? When (if their assertions were true)
concerning the divels usuall taking of shapes, and walking, talking,
conferring, hurting, and all maner of dealing with mortall creatures,
Christs argument to Thomas had beene weake and easilie answered ;
yea the one halfe, or all the whole world might be inhabited by divels,
everie poore mans house might be hired over his head by a divell, he
might take the shape and favor of an honest woman, and plaie the
witch ; or of an honest man, and plaie the theefe, and so bring them
both, or whome he list to the gallowes : who seeth not the vanitie of
such assertions? For then the divell might in the likenes of an
honest man commit anie criminall offense ; as Lavaier in his nine-
teenth chapter De spectris reporteth of a grave wise magistrate in the
territorie of Ttgurie, who affirmed, that as he and his servant went
through certeine pastures, he espied in a morning, the divell in
likenes of one whome he knew verie well, wickedlie dealing with a
mare. Upon the sight whereof he immediatlie went to that fellowes
house, and certeinlie learned there, that the same person went not out
of his chamber that daie. And if he had not wiselie booked out the
matter, the good honest man (saith he) had surelie beene cast into
prison, and put on the racke, &c.

The like storie we read of one Cuftegimda, wife to Henrie the second
emperor of that name, in whose chamber the divell (in the likenes of
a yoongman, with whome she was suspected to be too familiar in
court) was often scene comming in and out. How beit, she was
purged by the triall Candetitzs ferri, and prooved innocent : for she
went upon glowing iron unhurt, &c. And yet Salotnon saith ; Maie
a man carrie fier in his bosome, and his clothes not be burned? Or
can a man go upon coles, & his feete not scortched ? And thus might
the divell get him up into everie pulpit, and spred heresies, as I doubt
not but he dooth in the mouth of wicked preachers, though not so
grosselie as is imagined and reported by the papists and witchmongers.
And because it shall not be said that I beelie them, I will cite a storie

remaining : who cannot perceive that all the residue heeretofore of

A conclusion against witchcraft, in maner and forme of
an Indticiioft.

lY this time all kentishmen know (a few fooles excepted)
that Robin goodfellowe is a knave. All wisemen under-
stand that witches miraculous enterprises, being contrarie
to nature, probabilitie and reason, are void of truth or
possibilitie. All protestants perceive, that popish charmes, conjura-
tions, execrations, and benedictions are not efifectuall, but be toies
and devises onelie to keepe the people blind, and to inrich the cleargie.
All christians see, that to confesse witches can doo as they saie, were
to attribute to a creature the power of the Creator. All children
well brought up conceive and spie, or at the least are taught, that
juglers miracles doo consist of legierdemaine and confederacie. The
verie heathen people are driven to confesse, that there can be no
such conference betweene a spirituall divell and a corporall witch,
as is supposed. For no doubt, all the heathen would then have
everie one his familiar divell ; for they would make no conscience
to acquaint themselves with a divell that are not acquainted with
God.

I have dealt, and conferred with manie (marrie I must confesse
papists for the most part) that mainteine every point of these
absurdities. And surelie I allow better of their judgements, than of
others, unto whome some part of these cousenages are discovered
and scene : and yet concerning the residue, they remaine as wise as
they were before ; speciallie being satisfied in the highest and greatest
parts of conjuring and cousening ; to wit, in poperie, and yet will be
abused with beggerhe jugling, and witchcraft.

doubts, difficulties and exceptions, 3'et will I give free libertie to others
to beleeve them, if they list ; for that they doo not directlie oppugne
my purpose.

Manie great and grave authors write, and mania fond writers also
affirme, that there are certeine families in Aplirica which with their
voices bewitch whatsoever they praise. Insomuch as, if they com-
mend either plant, corne, infant, horsse, or anie other beasts, the same
presentlie withereth, decaieth and dieth. This mysterie of witchcraft
is not unknowne or neglected of our witchmongers, and superstitious
fooles heere in Eziropa. But to shew you examples neere home heere in
England, as though our voice had the like operation : you shall not
heare a butcher or horssecourser cheapen a bullocke or a jade, but if
he buie him not, he saith, God save him ; if he doo forget it, and the
horsse or bullocke chance to die, the fault is imputed to the chapman.
Certeinelie the sentence is godlie, if it doo proceed from a faithfull and
a godlie mind : but if it be spoken as a superstitious charme, by
those words and syllables to compound with the fascination and mis-
adventure of infortunate words, the phrase is wicked and super-
stitious, though there were farre greater shew of godlinesse than
appeereth therein.

Of inchanting or bewitching eies.

I AN IE writers agree with Virgil and Theocritus in the
effect of witching eies, affirming that in Scythia, there are
women called Bithice, having two balles or rather blacks
in the apple of their eies. And as Didymus reporteth,
some have in the one eie two such balles, and in the other the image
of a horsse. These (forsooth) with their angrie lookes doo bewitch
and hurt not onelie yoong lambs, but yoong children. There be other
that reteine such venome in their eies, and send it foorth by beames
and streames so violentlie, that therewith they annoie not onlie them
with whom they are conversant continuallie ; but also all other,
whose companie they frequent, of what age, strength, or complexion
soever they be : as Cicero, Pbitarch, Philarchus, and manie others
give out in their writings.

This fascination (saith John Baptista Porta Neapolita7tus) though
it begin by touching or breathing, is alwaies accomplished and
finished by the eie, as an extermination or expulsion of the spirits



of Witchci'aft. chap. 9. 409

through the eies, approching to the hart of the bewitched, and J.Bap.Nca-
infecting the same, &c. Wherby it commeth to passe, that a child, nat'rJu' '^^
or a yoong man endued with a cleare, whole, subtill and sweet bloud, '"''fi'^^-
yeeldeth the like spirits, breath, and vapors springing from the purer
bloud of the hart. And the lightest and finest spirits, ascending into 486.
the highest parts of the head, doo fall into the eies, and so are from
thence sent foorth, as being of all other parts of the bodie the most
cleare, and fullest of veines and pores, and with the verie spirit or
vapor proceeding thence, is conveied out as it were by beames and
streames a certeine fierie force ; whereof he that beholdeth sore eies This is held
shall have good experience. For the poison and disease in the eie in- °iuth'"'^ "^""^
fecteth the aire next unto it, and the same proceedeth further, carrieng
with it the vapor and infection of the corrupted bloud : with the con-
tagion whereof, the eies of the beholders are most apt to be infected.
By this same meanes it is thought that the cockatrice depriveth the
life, and a woolfe taketh awaie the voice of such as they suddenlie
meete withall and behold.

Old women, in whome the ordinarie course of nature faileth in the
office of purging their naturall monethlie humors, shew also some
proofe hereof For (as the saidy.^^.'.iV. reporteth, alledging ^rj--
iotle for his author) they leave in a looking glasse a certeine froth,
by meanes of the grosse vapors proceeding out of their eies. Which
commeth so to passe, bicause those vapors or spirits, which so
abundantlie come from their eies, cannot pearse and enter into the
glasse, which is hard, and without pores, and therefore resisteth : but Non est in
the beames which are carried in the chariot or conveiance of the f,^^"^Zci7.
spirits, from the eies of one bodie to another, doo pearse to the in- latur in co.
ward parts, and there breed infection, whilest they search and seeke
for their proper region. And as these beames & vapors doo proceed
from the hart of the one, so are they turned into bloud about the
hart of the other : which bloud disagreeing with the nature of the

bewitched partie, infeebleth the rest of his bodie, and

maketh him sicke : the contagion wherof so long con-

tinueth, as the distempered bloud hath force in the

members. And bicause the infection is of bloud,

the fever or sicknes will be continuall ;

whereas if it were of choler, or

flegme, it would be

intermittent or

alterable.

'^^7- 351. The tenth Chapter.

Of natiirall luitchn-aft for love, &^c.

UT as there is fascination and witchcraft by mahcious and
angrie eies unto displeasure : so are there witching as-
pects, tending contrariwise to love, or at the least, to the
procuring of good will and liking. For if the fascination
or witchcraft be brought to passe or provoked by the desire, by the
wishing and coveting of anie beautifull shape or favor, the venome is
strained through the eies, though it be from a far, and the imagination
of a beautiful! forme resteth in the hart of the lover, and kmdleth
the fier wherewith it is afflicted. And bicause the most delicate,
sweete, and tender bloud of the belooved doth there wander, his
countenance is there represented shining in his owne bloud, and
cannot there be cjuiet ; and is so haled from thence, that the bloud
of him that is wounded, reboundeth and slippeth into the wounder,
according to the saieng of Lucretiics the poet to the like purpose and
meaning in these verses :

Idqiie petit corpus, mens nude est saucia ainore,
Ndinqne onines pleriinque cadunt in vtilnus, &^ ilhun
Eniicat in partem sanguis, unde icitnur ictu ;
Et si coniiniis est, as turn ruber occupat hutnor :

And to that bodie tis rebounded,
From whence the mind by love is wounded,
For in a maner all and some.
Into that wound of love doo come,]
j^gg A)id to that part the bloud doth flee

From whence with stroke we striken bee,
If hard at hand, and neere in place,
Then ruddie colour files the face.

Thus much may seeme sufficient touching this matter of naturall
magicke ; whereunto though much more may be annexed, yet for the
avoiding of tediousnes, and for speedier passage to that which
remaineth ; I will breake off this present treatise.
And now somewhat shall be said con-
cerning divels and spirits
in the discourse
following.

[» This line Itnl.]




The first Chapter.

HERE is no question nor theme (saith Hierome Cardane)
so difficult to deale in, nor so noble an argument to dis-
pute upon, as this of divels and spirits. For that being
confessed or doubted of, the eternitie of the soule is
either affirmed or denied. The heathen philosophers reson hereof
amongest themselves in this sort. First, they that mainteine the
perpetuitie of the soule, saie that if the soule died with the bodie ;
to what end should men take paines either to live well or die well,
when no reward for vertue nor punishment for vice insueth after
this life, the which otherwise they might spend in ease and securitie?
The other sort saie that vertue and honestie is to be pursued, Non
spe prcBmii^i sed virtiitis amore, that is, Not for hope of reward, but
for love of vertue. If the soule live ever (saie the other) the least
portion of life is here. And therefore we that mainteine the perpe-
tuitie of the soule, may be of the better comfort and courage, to
susteine with more constancie the losse of children, yea and the
losse of life it selfe : whereas, if the soule were mortall, all our hope
and felicitie were to be placed in this life, which manie Atheists (I
warrant you) at this dale doo. But both the one and the other
missed the cushion. For, to doo anie thing without Christ, is to
wearie our selves in vaine ; sith in him onelie our corruptions are
purged. And therefore the follie of the Gentils, that place Snnunntn
bonum in the felicitie of the bodie, or in the happines or pleasures of
the mind, is not onelie to be derided, but also abhorred. For, both
our bodies and minds are intermedled with most miserable calamities:
and therefore therin cannot consist perfect felicitie. But in the word
of God is exhibited and offi^red unto us that hope which is most
certeine, absolute, sound & sincere, not to be answered or denied by
the judgement of philosophers themselves. For they that prcferre

temperance before all other things as Suviimtni boninn, must needs
see it to be but a witnesse of their naturall calamitie, corruption and
wickednes ; and that it serveth for nothing, but to restraine the
dissolutenes, which hath place in their minds infected with vices ;
which are to be bridled with such corrections : yea and the best of
them all faileth in some point of modestie. Wherefore serveth our
philosophers prudence, but to provide for their owne foUie and
miserie ; whereby they might else be utterlie overthrowne .'' And if
their nature were not intangled in errors, they should have no need
353. of such circumspection. The justice whereof they speake, serveth
but to keepe them from ravine, theft, and violence : and yet none of
them all are so just, but that the verie best and uprightest of them
fall into great infirmities, both dooing and suffering much wrong and
injurie. And what is their fortitude, but to arme them to endure
miserie, greefe, danger, and death it selfe } But what happinesse or
goodnesse is to be reposed in that life, which must be waited upon
with such calamities, and finallie must have the helpe of death to
finish it ? I saie, if it be so miserable, why doo they place Suvumtm
bomim therein 1 S. Paule to the Romatis sheweth, that it cannot be
that we should atteine to justice, through the morall and naturall
actions and duties of this life : bicause that never the Jewes nor the
Gentiles could expresse so much in their lives, as the verie lawe of
nature or of Moses required. And therefore he that worketh without
Christ, doth as he that reckoneth without his host.

FOR my part doo also thinke this argument, about the

as I am persuaded that no one author hath in anie certeine

Saddiices & Peripatetiks, who denie that there are any divels or
spirits at all ; nor the fond & superstitious treatises oi Plato, Proclns,
Plotinus, Porphyrie ; nor yet the vaine & absurd opinions of Psellus,

the earth ; so in the fourth element, which is the fier, is the habitation
of spirits and divels. And least we should thinke them idle, they saie
they have charge over men, and governement in all countries and

nations. Some saie that they are onelie imaginations in the The Sad-

The Opinion of Psellus tojichino; spirits., of their severall orders.,
and a confutation of his errors thcrei7t.

fSELLUS being of authoritie in the church o{ Rome, and
not impugnable by anie catholike, being also instructed
in these supernaturall or rather diabolical! matters by a
monke called Marct(s, who had beene familiarlie convers-
ant a long time, as he said, with a certeine divell, reporteth upon the
same divels owne word, which must needs understand best the state of
this question, that the bodies of angels and divels consist not now of all
one element, though perhaps it were otherwise before the fall of Ltecij-
fcr; and that the bodies of spirits and divels can feele and be felt, doo
hurt and be hurt : in so much as they lament when they are stricken;
and being put to the fier are burnt, and yet that they themselves
burne continuallie, in such sort as they leave ashes behind them in
places where they have beene ; as manifest triall thereof hath beene
(if he saie truelie) in the borders of Italie. He also saith upon like
credit and assurance, that divels and spirits doo avoid and shed from
out of their bodies, such seed or nature, as whereby certeine vermine
are ingendered ; and that they are nourished with food, as we are,
saving that they receive it not into their mouthes, but sucke it up
into their bodies, in such sort as sponges soke up water. Also he
saith they have names, shapes, and dwelling places, as indeed they
have, though not in temporall and corporall sort.

Furthermore, he saith, that there are six principal! kind of divels,
which are not onelie corporall, but temporall and worldlie. The first
sort consist of fier, wandering in the region neere to the moone, but
have no power to go into the moone. The second sort consisting of
aire, have their habitation more lowe and neere unto us : these (saith
he) are proud and great boasters, verie wise and deceitful], and when
they come downe are seene shining with streames of fier at their
taile. He saith that these are commonlie conjured up to make images
laugh, and lamps burne of their owne accord ; and that in Assyria
they use much to prophesie in a bason of water. Which kind of
incantation is usuall among our conjurors : but it is here commonlie
performed in a pitcher or pot of water ; or else in a violl of glasse
filled with water, wherin they say at the first a litle sound is heard
without a voice, which is a token of the divels comming. Anon the
water seemeth to be troubled, and then there are heard small voices.



Divels and spirits.



Chap. 3.

wherewith they give their answers, speaking so softlie as no man can
well heare them : bicause (saith Cardane) they would not be argued
or rebuked of lies. But this I have else-where more largelie de-
scribed and confuted. The third sort of divels Pselhts saith are
earthlie ; the fourth waterie, or of the sea ; the fift under the earth ;
the sixt sort are Lnciftigi, that is, such as delight in darkenes, & are
scant indued with sense, and so dull, as they can scarse be mooved
with charmes or conjurations.

The same man saith, that some divels are woorse than other, but
yet that they all hate God, and are enimies to man. But the woorser
moitie of divels are Aqtcei, Stebterranet, and Liicifugi •* that is,
waterie, under the earth, and shunners of light : bicause (saith he)
these hurt not the soules of men, but destroie mens bodies like mad
and ravening beasts, molesting both the inward and outward parts
thereof. Aqiiei are they that raise tempests, and drowne seafaring
men, and doo all other mischeefes on the water. Subterranei and
Lticiftigi enter into the bowels of men, and torment them that they
possesse with the phrensie, and the falling evill. They also assault
them that are miners or pioners, which use to worke in deepe and
darke holes under the earth. Such divels as are earthie and aierie,
he saith enter by subtiltie into the minds of men, to deceive them,
provoking men to absurd and unlawfull affections.

But herein his philosophie is verie unprobable, for if the divell be

earthie, he must needs be palpable ; if he be palpable, he must needs

kill them into whose bodies he entereth. Item, if he be of earth

created, then must he also be visible and untransformable in that

point : for Gods creation cannot be annihilated by the creature. So

as, though it were granted, that they might adde to their substance

matter and forme, &c : yet is it most certeine, that they cannot

diminish or alter the substance whereof they consist, as not to be

(when they list) spirituall, or to relinquish and leave earth, water,

fier, aier, or this and that element whereof they are created. But

howsoever they imagine of water, aier, or fier, I am sure earth must

alwaies be visible and palpable ; yea, and aier must alwaies be invisible,

and fier must be hot, and water must be moist. And of these

three latter bodies, speciallie of water and aier, no

forme nor shape can be exhibited to

mortall eies naturallie, or by

the power of anie

creature.

^pj. 350. The fourth Chapter.

More absurd assertions of Pselhcs and such others., concerning the
actions and passions of spirits., his definition of them, and of
his experience therein.

OREOVER, the same author saith, that spirits whisper

in our minds, and yet not speaking so lowd, as our eares

may heare them : but in such sort as our soules speake

together when they are dissolved ; making an example

by lowd speaking a farre off, and a comparison of soft whispering

neere hand, so as the divell entreth so neere to the mind as the eare

need not heare him ; and that everie part of a divell or spirit seeth,

heareth, and speaketh, &c. But herein I will beleeve Paule better

than Psellus, or his monke, or the moonks divell. For Paule saith ;

If the whole bodie were an eie, where were hearing? If the whole

bodie were hearing, where were smelling, &c. Whereby you may

see what accord is betwixt Gods word and witchmongers.

The papists proceed in this matter, and saie, that these spirits use
great knaverie and unspeakeable bawderie in the breech and middle
parts of man and woman, by tickeling, and by other lecherous
devises ; so that they fall jumpe in judgement and opinion, though
verie erroniouslie, with the foresaid Psellus, of whose doctrine also
this is a parcell ; to wit, that these divels hurt not cattell for the hate
they beare unto them, but for love of their naturall and temperate
heate and moisture, being brought up in deepe, drie and cold places:
marie they hate the heate of the sun and the fier, bicause that kind
of heate drieth too fast. They throwe downe stones upon men, but
the blowes thereof doo no harme to them whome they hit ; bicause
they are not cast with anie force : for (saith he) the divels have little
and small strength, so as these stones doo nothing but fraie and
terrifie men, as scarecrowes doo birds out of the coine feelds. But
when these divels enter into the pores, than doo they raise woonder-
4g6. full tumults in the bodie and mind of man. And if it be a subterrene
divell, it dooth writh and bow the possessed, and speaketh by him,
using the spirit of the patient as his instrument. But he saith, that
when Lucifigus possesseth a man, he maketh him dumbe, and as it
were dead : and these be they that are cast out (saith he) onelie by
fasting and praier.

The same Psellus, with his mates Bodin and the penners of M.
Mai. and others, doo find fault with the physicians that affirme such



Divels and spirits. chap 4- 417

infirmities to be cureable with diet, and not by inchantments ; saieng,
that physicians doo onlie attend upon the bodie, & that which is
perceiveable by outward sense ; and that as touching this kind of
divine philosophic, they have no skill at all. And to make divels and id.;n.cap. 17
spirits seeme yet more corporall and terrene, he saith that certeine
divels are belonging to certeine countries, and speake the languages
of the same countries, and none other ; some the Assyrian, some
the ChaldcBan, & some the Persian toong, and that they feele stripes,
and feare hurt, and speciallie the dint of the sword (in which respect 357.
conjurors have swords with them in their circles, to terrifie them) and
that they change shapes, even as suddenlie as men doo change colour
with blushing, feare, anger, and other moods of the mind. He saith
yet further, that there be brute beasts among them, and yet divels, ^eaSjt_|'^«
and subject to anie kind of death ; insomuch as they are so foolish,
as they may be compared to flies, fleas, and wormes, who have no
respect to any thing but their food, not regarding or remembring the
hole from out of whence they came last. Marrie divels compounded
of earth, cannot often transforme themselves, but abide in some one
shape, such as they best like, and most delight in ; to wit, in the
shape of birds or women : and therefore the Greeks call them Neidas,
Nereidas, and Dreidas in the feminine gender ; which Dreidce inha-
bited (as some write) the ilands beside Scotland Q.?L\\&diDruidcB,^\v\z\\.
by that meanes had their denomination and name. Other divels that
dwell in drier places transforme themselves into the masculine kind.
Finallie Psellus saith they know our thoughts, and can prophesie of
things to come. His definition is, that they are perpetuall minds in ^^l^'^^]"-^
a passible bodie. thing him-

• • selfe

To verefie these toies he saith, that he himselfe sawe m a certeme
night a man brought up by Aldus Libius into a mountaine, and that 497-
he tooke an hearbe, and spat thrise into his mouth, and annointed
his eies with a certeine ointment, so as thereby he sawe great troopes ^''°'^j?^'®.
of divels, and perceived a crowe to flie into his mouth ; and since stuflfe.
that houre he could prophesie at all times, saving on good fridaie,
and easter sundaie. If the end of this tale were true, it might not
onelie have satisfied the Greeke church, in keeping the daie of easter,
togither with the church of Rome ; but might also have made the

The fift Chapter.

The opinion of Fascitis Cardanus touching spirits, and of his
familiar divell.

I ASCIUS CARDANUS had (as he himselfe and his sonne
HieroDie Cardatms report) a familiar divell, consisting of
the fierie element, who, so long as he used conjuration,
did give true answers to all his demands : but when he
burned up his booke of conjurations, though he resorted still unto
him, yet did he make false answers continuallie. He held him bound
twentie & eight yeares, and loose five yeares. And during the time
that he was bound, he told him that there were manic divels or spirits.
He came not alwaies alone, but sometimes some of his fellowes with
him. He rather agreed with Psellus than with Plato : for he said
they were begotten, borne, died, and lived long ; but how long, they
told him not : howbeit as he might conjecture by his divels face, who
was 42. yeares old, and yet appeared verie yoong, he thought they
lived two or three hundred yeares ; and they said that their soules
and ours also died with their bodies. They had schooles and uni-
versities among them : but he conceived not that anie were so dull
headded, as Psellus maketh them. But they are verie quicke in
credit, that beleeve such fables, which indeed is the groundworke of
witchcraft and conjuration. But these histories are so grosse and
palpable, that I might be thought as wise in going about to confute
them, as to answer the stories of Frier Rush, Adam Bell, or the
golden Legend.

The opinion of Plato concerning spirits, divels and angels, what
sacrifices they like best, what they feare, and of Socrates his
familiar divell.

IlATO and his followers hold, that good spirits appeare
in their owne likenesse ; but that evill spirits appeare
and shew themselves in the forme of other bodies ; and
that one divell reigneth over the rest, as a prince dooth
in everie perfect commonwelth over men. Item, they obteine their
purposes and desires, onelie by intreatie, of men and women ; bicause

in nature they are their inferiors, and use authoritie over men none
otherwise than priests by vertue of their function, and bicause of
religion, wherein (they saie) they execute the office of God. Some-
times they saie that the fierie spirits or supreme substances enter
into the puritie of the mind, and so obteine their purpose ; sometimes
otherwise, to wit, by vertue of holie charmes, and even as a poore
man obteineth for Gods sake anie thing at a princes hand as it were
by importunatnesse.

The other sort of divels and defiled soules are so conversant on
earth, as that they doo much hurt unto earthlie bodies, speciallie in
lecherie. Gods and angels (saie they) bicause they want all material!
and grosse substance, desire most the pure sacrifice of the mind.
The grosser and more terrestriall spirits desire the grosser sacrifices ;
as beasts and cattell. They in the middle or meane region delight
to have frankincense, and such meane stuffe offered unto them : and
therefore (saie they) it is necessarie to sacrifice unto them, all maner
of things, so the same be slaine, and die not of their owne accord :
for such they abhorre. Some saie that spirits feare woonderfullie
vaine threats, and thereupon will depart ; as if you tell them that
you will cut the heavens in peeces, or reveale their secrets, or com-
plaine of them to the gods, or saie that you will doo anie impossi-
bilitie, or such things as they cannot understand ; they are so
timerous, as they will presentlie be gone : and that is thought the
best waie to be rid of them. But these be most commonlie of that
sort or companie, which are called Principatus^ being of all other
the most easie to be conjured.

They saie Socrates had a familiar divell : which Plato relieth much
upon, using none other argument to proove that there are such spirits,
but bicause Socrates (that would not lie) said so ; and partlie bicause
that divell did ever dissuade and prohibit, not onelie in Socrates his
owne cases, but sometimes in his freends behalfe ; who (if they had
beene ruled) might through his admonition have saved their lives.
His disciples gathered that his divell was Saturnall, and a principall
fierie divell ; and that he, and all such as doo naturallie know their
divels, are onlie such as are called Dcemonii viri, otherwise, Cousen-
ers. Item, they saie that fierie spirits urge men to contemplation,
the aierie to busines, the waterie to lust ; and among these there are
some that are Martiall, which give fortitude; some are Joviall, giving
wisedome ; some Saturniall, alwaies using dissuasion and dehorting.
Item, some are borne with us, and remaine with us all our life ; some
are meere strangers, who are nothing else but the soules of men
departed this life, &c.

Platos nine order's of spirits and angels, Dionysius his division
thereof not much diffe^-ing from the savie, all disprooved by
learned divines.

|LAT0 proposeth or setteth foorth nine severall orders of
spirits, besides the spirits and soules of men. The first
spirit is God that commandeth all the residue ; the
second are those that are called Idea:., which give all
things to all men ; the third are the soules of heavenlie bodies which
are mortall ; the fourth are angels ; the fift archangels ; the sixt are
divels, who are ministers to infernall powers, as angels are to super-
nall ; the seventh are halfe gods ; the eight are principalities ; the
ninth are princes. From which division Dionysius dooth not much
swarve, saving that he dealeth (as he saith) onelie with good spirits,
whome he likewise divideth into nine parts or offices. The first he
calleth Seraphim, the second Cherubim, the third thrones, the fourth
dominations, the fift vertues, the sixt powers, the seventh principali-
ties, the eight archangels, the ninth and inferior sort he calleth angels.
Howbeit, some of these (in my thinking) are evill spirits : or else
Paiile gave us evill counsel!, when he willed us to fight against prin-
cipalities, and powers, and all spiritual! wickednes.

But Dionysius in that place goeth further, impropriating to everie
countrie, and almost to everie person of anie accompt, a peculiar
angell ; as to Jewrie, he assigneth Michael ; to Adam, Razael ; to
Abraham, Zakiel \ to Isaach, Raphael; to Jacob, Peliel ; to Moses,
Metraton, &c. But in these discourses he either folowed his owne
imaginations and conceipts, or else the corruptions of that age.
Nevertheles, I had rather confute him by M. Calvine, and my
kinseman M. Deering, than by my selfe, or mine owne words.
For M. Calvine saith, that Dionysius herein speaketh not as by
hearesaie, but as though he had slipped downe from heaven, and
told of things which he had seene. And yet (saith he) Paule
was rapt into the third heaven, and reporteth no such matters. But
if you read M. Deering upon the first chapter to the Hebrues, you
shall see this matter notablie handled ; where he saith, that whenso-
ever archangel! is mentioned in the scriptures, it signifieth our saviour
Christ, and no creature. And certeine it is that Christ himselfe was
called an angell. The names also of angels, as Michael, Gabj'iel,
&^c : are given to them (saith Calvine) according to the capacitie of

our weakenesse. But bicause the decision of this question is neither
within the compasse of mans capacitie, nor yet of his knowledge, I
will proceed no further to discusse the same, but to shew the absurd
opinions of papists and witchmongers on the one side, and the most
sober and probable collections of the contrarie minded on the other
side.



The eight Chapter.

The commensement of divels fondlie gathered out of the 14. of
Isaie^i of Lucifer and of his fall, the Cabalists the Thalmudists
and Schoole>netis opinions of the creation of angels.

HE witchmoongers, which are most commonlie bastard
divines, doo fondlie gather and falselie conceive the
commensement of divels out of the fourteenth of Isaie ;
where they suppose Lucifer is cited, as the name of an Isai. 14.
angell ; who on a time being desirous to be checkemate with God
himselfe, would needs (when God was gone a litle asside) be sitting
downe, or rather pirking up in Gods owne principall and cathedrall
chaire ; and that therfore God cast him and all his confederates out
of heaven : so as some fell downe from thence to the bottome of the
earth ; some having descended but into the midle region, and the
taile of them having not yet passed through the higher region, staied
even then & there, when God said. Ho. But God knoweth there is
no such thing ment nor mentioned in that place. For there is onlie
foreshowed the deposing and deprivation of king N'abtechadnez-zar,]
who exalting himselfe in pride (as it were above the starres) esteemed J02.
his glorie to surmount all others, as farre as Lucifer the bright morn-
ing starre shineth more gloriouslie than the other common starres,
and was pimished by exile, untill such time as he had humbled him-
selfe ; and therefore metaphoricallie was called Lucifer.

But forsooth, bicause these great clarkes would be thought method-
ical!, and to have crept out of wisedomes bosome, who rather cralled
out of follies breeches ; they take upon them to shew us, first, whereof
these angels that fell from heaven were created ; to wit, of the left The opini
side of that massie moold, whereof the world was compounded, the Thair
which (saie they) was Putredo terrce, that is, the rottennesse of the
earth. The Cabalists, with whome Avicen seemeth to agree, saie that
one of these begat another : others saie, they were made all at once. 361
The Greekes doo write that angels were created before the world.
The Latinists saie they were made the fourth daie, when the starres

There is also a great question among the schoolemen, whether more
angels fell downe with Lticifer., or remained in heaven with Michael.
Manie having a bad opinion of the angels honesties, affirme that the
greater part fell with lAicifcr : but the better opinion is (saith
Laiirentms Attanias) that the most part remained. And of them
that thinke so, some saie the tenth part were cast downe, some the
ninth ; and some gather upon S.oJui, that the third part were onelie
damned ; bicause it is written, that the dragon with his taile plucked
downe with him the third part of the starres.

0 the contention bet%ueene the Greeke and Latine church touching
the fall of angels., the variance among papists themselves herein.,
a conflict betweene Michael and L-ucifer.

HERE was also another contention betweene the Greeke
church and the Latine ; to wit, of what orders of angels
they were that did fall with Lucifer. Our schoolemen saie
they were of all the nine orders of angels in Lticifers
conspiracie. But bicause the superior order was of the more noble
constitution and excellent estate, and the inferior of a lesse worthie
nature, the more part of the inferior orders fell as guiltie and offenders
with Ljicifer. Some saie the divell himselfe was of the inferior order
of angels, and some that he was of the highest order : bicause it is
written, hi cherubim extentus £^ protegens posui te in monte sancto
Dei. And these saie further, that he was called the dragon, bicause
of his excellent knowledge. Finallie, these great doctors conclude,
that the divell himselfe was of the order of seraphim, which is the
highest, because it is written, Quomodo enim maiil oriebaris Lucifer ?\
They of this sect affirme, that Cacodamones were they that rebelled
against yicT^ ; I meane they of Plato his sect, himselfe also holding
the same opinion. Our schoolemen differ much in the cause of
Lucifers fall. For some said it was for speaking these words,
Potiain sedeni meam in aguilone, Or' similis ero altissimo:X others saie,
bicause he utterlie refused felicitie, and thought scorne therof;
others saie, bicause he thought all his strength proceeded from him-

grew hereupon, for that he challenged the place of the Messias ;

others saie, bicause he detracted the time to adore the majestic of

God, as other angels did ; others saie, bicause he utterlie refused it. 504-

ScotnsdSidiYixs disciples saie that it was, bicause he rebelliouslie claimed

equall omnipotencie with God : with whom lightlie the Thomists

never agree. Others saie it was for all these causes together, and

manie more: so as hereupon (saith Laurentms Ananias^ grew a Laur.Anan.

^•onderfull conflict betweene Michael and the good angels on the one dam'i!"""''

side, and L^ccifer and his freends on the other : so as, after a long

and doubtfull skirmish, Michael overthrew Lucifer, and turned him

and his fellowes out of the doores.



The tenth Chapter.




Where the battell betweene Michael and Lucifer was fought, how
long it continued^ and of their power, how fondlie papists and
infidels write of thon, and how reveretttlie Christians ought to
tJiinke of them.

I OW where this battell was fought, and how long it con-
tinued, there is as great contention among the schoole-
men, as was betwixt Michael and Lucifer. The
BSj Thomists saie this battell was fought in the mpereiall* [» sic\
heaven, where the abode is of blessed spirits, and the place of
pleasure and felicitie. Augustine and manie others saie, that the
battell was fought in the highest region of the aier ; others saie, in
the firmament ; others in paradise. The Thomists also saie it con- j,^stans viz.
tinued but one instant or pricke of time ; for they tarried but two functum
instants in all, even from their creation to their expulsion. The '^'" ■■ "^"^ "
Scotists saie, that betweene their production and their fall, there were
just foure instants. Nevertheles, the greatest number of schoolemen
affirme, that they continued onelie three instants : bicause it stood
with Gods justice, to give them three warnings ; so as at the third
warning Lucifer fell downe like led (for so are the words) to the
bottome of hell ; the rest were left in the aire, to tempt man. The
Sadduces were as grosse the other waie : for they said, that by angels
was ment nothing else, but the motion that God dooth inspire in men,
or the tokens of his power. He that readeth Eusebius shall see joj.

manie more absurd opinions and asseverations of angels: as how
manie thousand yeares they serve as angels, before they come to the
promotion of archangels, &c.

Monsieur Bodin, M. Mai. and manie other papists gather upon the
seventh of Da7iiel, that there are just ten millians of angels in heaven.
Manie saie that angels are not by nature, but by office. Finallie, it
were infinite to shew the absurd and curious collections hereabout. I
for my part thinke with Cahnne, that angels are creatures of God ;
though Moses spake nothing of their creation, who onelie applied him-
selfe to the capacitie of the common people, reciting nothing but
things seene. And I saie further with him, that they are heavenlie
spirits, whose ministration and service God useth : and in that respect
are called angels. I saie yet againe with him, that it is verie certeine,
that they have no shape at all ; for they are spirits, who never have
anie : and finallie, I saie with him, that the scriptures, for the
capacitie of our wit, dooth not in vaine paint out angels unto us with
wings ; bicause we should conceive, that they are readie swiftlie to
succour us. And certeinlie all the sounder divines doo conceive and
give out, that both the names and also the number of angels are set
downe in the scripture by the Holie-ghost, in termes to make us
understand the greatnesse and the manner of their messages ; which
(I saie) are either expounded by the number of angels, or signified by
their names.

Furthermore, the schoole doctors affirme, that foure of the superior
orders of angels never take anie forme or shape of bodies, neither
are sent of anie arrand at anie time. As for archangels, they are
sent onelie about great and secret matters ; and angels are com-
mon hacknies about evere trifle ; and that these can take what shape
or bodie they list : marie they never take the forme of women or
children. Item they saie that angels take most terrible shapes : for
Gabriel appeared to Marie, when he saluted hir. Facie rutilante,
veste coruscante, iftgresstf viirabili, aspectu terribili, &^e : that is,
with a bright countenance, shining attire, wonderfull gesture, and a
dredful vissage, &c. But of apparitions I have spoken somewhat
before, and will saie more hearafter. It hath beene long, and con-
tinueth yet a constant opinion, not onelie among the papists ; but
among others also, that everie man hath assigned him, at the time of
his nativitie, a good angell and a bad. For the which there is no
reason in nature, nor authoritie in scripture. For not one angell, but
all the angels are said to rejoise more of one convert, than of ninetie
and nine just. Neither did one onelie angell conveie Lazarus into
Abrahams bosome. And therefore I conclude with Calvine, that he
which referreth to one angell, the care that GOD hath to everie one

of angels, let us reverentHe thinke of them, and not curiouslie search
into the nature of them, considering the vilenes of our condition, in
respect of the glorie of their creation. And as for the foresaid fond
imaginations and fables of Lucifer^ Ss-'c: they are such as are not
onelie ridiculous, but also accomptable among those impious curiosi-
ties, and vaine questions, which Paiile speaketh of : neither have
they anie tittle or letter in the scripture for the maintenance of their
grosse opinions in this behalfe.



The eleventh Chapter.




Whether they became divels which being angels kept not their
vocation, in tide ajid Peter j of the fond opinions of the Rabbins
totiching spirits and bugs, with a confiitatioti thereof.

E doo read in fude, and find it confirmed in Peter, that
the angels kept not their first estate, but left their owne
habitation, and sinned, and (as fob saith) committed
follie : and that God therefore did cast them downe into
hell, reserving them in everlasting chaines under darkenes, unto the
judgement of the great daie. But manie divines saie, that they find
not anie where, that God made divels of them, or that they became
the princes of the world, or else of the aire ; but rather prisoners.
Howbeit, divers doctors affirme, that this Lucifer, notwithstanding
his fall, hath greater power than any of the angels in heaven : marrie
they say that there be certeine other divels of the inferiour sort of
angels, which were then thrust out for smaller faults, and therefore
are tormented with little paines, besides eternal damnation : and these
(saie they) can doo little hurt. They affirme also, that they onelie use
certeine jugling knacks, delighting thereby to make men laugh, as
they travell by the high waies : but other (saie they) are much more
churlish. For proofe heereof they alledge the eighth of Matthew,
where he would none otherwise be satisfied but by exchange, from
the annoieng of one man, to the destruction of a whole heard of
swine. The Rabbittes, and namelie Rabbi Abraham, writing upon the
second of Genesis, doo say, that God made the fairies, bugs, hicubus,
Robin good fellow, and other familiar or domesticall spirits & divels
on the fridaie : and being prevented with the evening of the sabboth,
finished them not, but left them unperfect ; and tlierefore, that ever

But as these opinions are ridiculous and fondlie collected ; so if we

have onelie respect to the bare word, or rather to the letter, where

in his generation, as I take him to be, if he would terrifie men with
such uglie shapes, though he could doo it at his pleasure. For by
that meanes men should have good occasion & oportunitie to flie
from him, & to run to God for succour ; as the maner is of all them
that are terrified, though perchance they thought not upon God of
long time before. But in truth we never have so much cause to be
afraid of the divell, as when he flatteringlie insinuateth himselfe into
our harts, to satisfie, please, and serve our humors, entising us to
prosecute our owne appetits and pleasures, without anie of these
externall terrors. I would weete of these men, where they doo find
^08. in the scriptures, that some divels be spirituall, and some corporall ;
or how these earthie or waterie divels enter into the mind of man.

is a spirit, can be knowne, or made tame and familiar unto a naturall

man ; or contrarie to nature, can be by a witch made corporall, being

by God ordeined to a spirituall proportion .''

The cause of this grosse conceipt is, that we hearken more dili-
gentlie to old wives, and rather give credit to their fables, than
to the word of God ; imagining by the tales they tell us, that the divell 3og.
is such a bulbegger, as I have before described. For whatsoever is
proposed in scripture to us by parable, or spoken figurativelie or
significativelie, or framed to our grosse capacities, &c : is by them so
considered and expounded, as though the bare letter, or rather their
grosse imaginations thereupon were to be preferred before the true
sense and meaning of the word. For I dare saie, that when these
blockheads re.a.d Joihans parable in the ninth of Judges to the men
of Sichem ; to wit, that the trees went out to annoint a king over judg. 9. 7 8
them, saieng to the olive tree, Reigne thou over us : who answered 9, 10. ",12,
and said, Should I leave my fatnesse, &c ? They imagine that the
woodden trees walked, & spake with a mans voice : or else, that
some spirit entred into the trees, and answered as is imagined they
did in the idols and oracles of Apollo^ and such like ; who indeed
have eies, and see not ; eares and heare not ; mouthes, and speake
not, &c.

Rom. 1,15. ^j.j(j therefore Panic saith. To one is given, by the spirit, the word of

9', 10. ' ' wisedome ; to another, the word of knowledge by the same spirit ;

to another, the gift of healing ; to another, the gift of faith by the
I. Co. 12, II. same spirit ; to another, the gift of prophesie ; to another, the opera-
tion of great works ; to another, the discerning of spirits; to another,
the diversitie of toongs; to another, the interpretation of toongs: and
all these things worketh one and the selfesame spirit. Thus farre the
Isai. 19, 14. words of "az^. And finallie, Esaie saith, that the Lord mingled

among them the spirit of error. And in another place. The Lord
Isaie. 29. hath covered you with a spirit of slumber.

As for the spirits of divination spoken of in the scripture, they are

I. Sara. 28. such Es was in the woman of Endor, the Philippian woman, the

Hest. 16. wench of Westwell, and the holie maid of Kent ; who were indued

with spirits or gifts of divination, whereby they could make shift to

gaine monie, and abuse the people by slights and craftie inventions.

But these are possessed of borrowed spirits, as it is written in the

Sap. 15,15, booke of Wisedome ; and spirits of meere cousenage and deceipt, as

'^' I have sufficientlie prooved elsewhere. I denie not therefore that

there are spirits and divels, of such substance as it hath pleased GOD

to create them. But in what place soever it be found or read in the

scriptures, a spirit or divell is to be understood spirituallie, and is

neither a corporall nor a visible thing. Where it is written, that God

judg. 9, 23. sent an evill spirit betweene Abi7nelech, and the men of Suheni, we

367. are to understand, that he sent the spirit of hatred, and not a bul-

Num. 5, 14. begger. Also where it is said ; If the spirit of gelosie come upon

him : it is as much to saie as ; If he be mooved with a gelous mind :

and not that a corporall divell assaulteth him. It is said in the Gos-

Luke. 13, II. pell; There was a woman, which had a spirit of infirmitie 18. yeeres,

5. who was bowed togithcr, &:c : whome Christ, by laieng his hand upon

hir, delivered of hir disease. Wherby it is to be scene, that although
it be said, that sathan had bound hir, &c: yet that it was a sicknes or
disease of bodie that troubled hir ; for Christs owne words expound
it. Neither is there any word of witchcraft mentioned, which some
saie was the cause thereof.

There were seven divels cast out of Marie Magdalen. Which is Mark. i6, 9.
not so grosselie understood by the learned, as that there were in hir
just seven corporall divels, such as I described before elsewhere ; but
that by the number of seven divels, a great multitude, and an uncer-
teine number of vices is signified : which figure is usuall in divers
places of the scripture. And this interpretation is more agreeable Levit. 26.
with Gods word, than the papisticall paraphrase, which is ; that luT' 17.
Christ, under the name of the seven divels, recounteth the seven
deadlie sinnes onelie. Others allow neither of these expositions ;
bicause they suppose that the efficacie of Christs miracle should this
waie be confounded : as though it were not as difficult a matter, with
a touch to make a good Christian of a vicious person ; as with a word
to cure the ague, or any other disease of a sicke bodie. I thinke not Matth. 8, 16.
but any of both these cures may be wrought by meanes, in processe
of time, without miracle ; the one by the preacher, the other by the
physician. But I saie that Christs worke in both was apparentlie
miraculous : for with power and authoritie, even with a touch of his
finger, and a word of his mouth, he made the blind to see, the halt to Luk. 4, 36.
go, the lepers cleane, the deafe to heare, the dead to rise againe, and " ' ' *''
the poore to receive the Gospell, out of whom (I saie) he cast divels,
and miraculouslie conformed them to become good Christians, which
before were dissolute livers; to whome he said, Go your waies and John 8, n.
sinne no more.

That it pleased God to manifest the power of his sonne and not of
witches by miracles.

JESUS CHRIST, to manifest his divine power, rebuked Luke. 8, m-
the winds, and they ceased ; and the waves of water, and
it was calme : which if neither our divines nor physicians

can doo, much lesse our conjurors, and least of all our old

witches can bring anie such thing to passe. But it pleased God to
manifest the power of Christ Jesus by such miraculous & extra-
ordinarie meanes, providing and as it were preparing diseases, that
none otherwise could be cured, that his sonnes glorie, and his peoples




430 Chap. 14. A discourse of

Levit. 14, 7, 8 faith might the more plainelie appeere ; as namehe, leprosie, lunacie,
' ^' ''^' ■*■ and blindnesse : as it is apparent in the Gospell, where it is said, that
John. 9. the man was not stricken with blindnesse for his owne sinnes, nor for

368. any offense of his ancestors ; but that he was made bhnd, to the
intent the works of God should be shewed upon him by the hands of
Jesus Christ. But witches with their charmes can cure (as witch-
mongers affirme) all these diseases mentioned in the scripture, and
manie other more ; as the gowt, the toothach, &c : which we find not
that ever Christ cured.
Mat. 4, 17, A§ touching those that are said in the Gospell to be possessed of

spirits, it seemeth in manie places that it is indifferent, or all one, to
saie ; He is possessed with a divell ; or, He is lunatike or phrentike:
which disease in these dales is said to proceed of melancholie. But
if everie one that now is lunatike, be possessed with a reall divell ;
then might it be thought, that divels are to be thrust out of men by
medicines. But who saith in these times with the woman of Canaa7i ;
My daughter is vexed with a divell, except it be presupposed, that she
meant hir daughter was troubled with some disease.'' Indeed we
saie, and saie truelie, to the wicked. The divell is in him : but we
meane not thereby, that a reall divell is gotten into his guts. And if
jj. it were so, I marvell in what shape this reall divell, that possesseth
them, remaineth. Entreth he into the bodie in one shape, and into
the mind in another } If they grant him to be spirituall and invisible,
I agree with them.

Some are of opinion, that the said woman of Chanaan ment indeed
that hir daughter was troubled with some disease ; bicause it is
Matt. 15, 28. written in sted of that the divell was cast out, that hir daughter was

made whole, even the selfesame houre. According to that which is
M-att. 12, 22. said in the 12. Qi Matthew ; There was brought unto Christ one pos-

sessed of a divell, which was both blind and dumbe, and he healed
him : so as, he that was blind and dumbe both spake and sawe.
But it was the man, and not the divell, that was healed,
and made to speake and see. Whereby (I saie) it is
gathered, that such as were diseased, as well
as they that were lunatike, were
said sometimes to be
possessed of
divels.

Chap. 15.

The XV. Chapter.

Of the possessed with divels.

I ERE I cannot omit to shew, how fondlie diverse writers ;
and namelie, James Spre7iger, and Heiirie Institor doo
gather and note the cause, why the divell maketh choise to
possesse men at certeine times of the moone ; which is
(saie they) in two respects : first, that they may defame so good a
creature as the moone ; secondly, bicause the braine is the moistest
part of the bodie. The divell therefore considereth the aptnesse and
conveniencie thereof (the *moone having dominion over all moist
things) so as they take advantage therby, the better to bring their
purposes to passe. And further they saie, that divels being conjured
and called up, appeere and come sooner in some certeine constella-
tions, than in other some : thereby to induce men to thinke, that
there is some godhead in the starres. But when Satile was releeved
with the sound of the harpe, they saie that the departure of the divell
was by meanes of the signe of the crosse imprinted in Da^nds veines.
Whereby we maie see how absurd the imaginations and devises of
men are, when they speake according to their owne fansies, without
warrant of the word of God. But me thinks it is verie absurd that
Josepliiis affirmeth; to wit, that the divell should be thrust out of anie
man by vertue of a root. And as vaine it is, that Eliamis writeth
of the magicall herbe Cynospasttis, otherwise called Agla\o'\photis ;
which is all one with Salomons root named Baaros, as having force
to drive out anie divell from a man possessed.

That we being fiot throughlie informed of the nature of divels
and spirits,, 7nust satisfe our selves with that which is de-
livered us i7t the scriptures touching the same., how this word
divell is to be understood both in the singular and piurallnian-
ber, of the spirit of God and the spirit of the divell, of tame
spirits, of Ahab.

HE nature therfore and substance of divels and spirits,

bicause in the scripture it is not so set down, as we may

certeinlie know the same : we ought to content and

frame our selves faithfullie to beleeve the words and sense

there deli\ ered unto us by the high spirit, which is the Holie-ghost, Num. 37, 16.




432 Chap. 1 6. A discourse of

who is Lord of all spirits ; alwaies considering, that evermore spirits
are spoken of in scripture, as of things spirituall; though for the helpe
of our capacities they are there sometimes more grosselie and corpo-
rallie expressed, either in parables or by metaphors, than indeed they
I. Reg. i8. are. As for example (and to omit the historic of Job^ which else-

verse 4^ where I handle) it is written ; The Lord said, Who shall entise AJiab,

that he maie fall at Ramoth Gilead, &^c? Then came foorth a spirit,
and stood before the Lord, and said ; I will entise him. And the
Lord said, Wherewith ? And he said ; I will go and be a lieng spirit
in the mouth of all his prophets. Then he said ; Go foorth, thou
shalt prevaile, &c.
jj. This storie is here set foorth in this wise, to beare with our capaci-
ties, and speciallie with the capacitie of that age, that could not
otherwise conceive of spirituall things, than by such corporall demon-
strations. And yet here is to be noted, that one spirit, and not
manie or diverse, did possesse all the false prophets at once. Even
Luke. 8. g^g jj^ another place, manie thousand divels are said to possesse one

Mark. 5. 9. man : and yet it is also said even in the selfe same place, that the

same man was possessed onelie with one divell. For it is there said
that Christ met a man, which had a divell, and he commanded the
J Cal.lib.in- fowle spirit to come foorth of the man, &c. But Calvine saith ;

sttt. lib. I. cap. ^ , . . ,

14. sect. 14. Where sathan or the divell is named m the smgular number, thereby

is meant that power of wickednesse, that standeth against the king-
dome of justice. And where manie divels are named in the scrip-
tures, we are thereby taught, that we must fight with an infinite
multitude of enimies; least despising the fewnesse of them, we should
be more slacke to enter into battell, and so fall into securitie and
idlenes.

On the other side, it is as plainelie set downe in the scripture, that

370. some are possessed with the spirit of God, as that the other are endued

and bound with the spirit of the divell. Yea som,etimes we read,

Num. II. that one good spirit was put into a great number of persons ; and

againe, that diverse spirits rested in and upon one man : and yet no

reall or corporall spirit meant. As for example ; The Lord tooke of

Ibid. vers. 25 the spirit that was upon Moses, and put it upon the seventie elders, and

when the spirit rested upon them, they prophesied. Why should not

this be as substantial! and corporall a spirit, as that, wherewith the

Acts 16. maid in the Acts of the apostles was possessed 1 Also Elisha in-

judg^^^.^o. treated Elia., that when he departed, his spirit might double upon

ajudg. "• 39- him. We read also that the spirit of the Lord came upon ^ Othniel,

c Ibid. 14. 6.' upon ^Gedeon, '^Jepiha, '^Saffison, ^Balaam., ^Sajile, ^David., ^Ezechiel,

^Daniel had a more excellent spirit than anie other. So as, though
the spirits, as well good as bad, are said to be given by number and
proportion ; yet the qualitie and not the quantitie of them is alwaies
thereby ment and presupposed. Howbeit I must confesse, that
Christ had the spirit of God without measure, as it is written in the
evangelist y^;;. But where it is said that spirits can be made tame,
and at commandement, I saie to those grosse conceivers of scripture
with Salomon, who (as they falslie affirme was of all others the
greatest conjuror) saith thus in expresse words ; No man is lord over
a spirit, to reteine a spirit at his pleasure.

The xvii. Chapter.

Whether spirits and sotiles can assume bodies, and of their
creation atid substance, wherein writers doo extreamelic contend
and varie.

OME hold opinion, that spirits and soules can assume &
take unto them bodies at their pleasure, of what shape
or substance they list : of which mind all papists, and
some protestants are, being more grosse than another
sort, wliich hold, that such bodies are made to their hands. How-
beit, these doo varie in the elements, wherewith these spirituall bodies
are composed. For (as I have said) some affirme that they consist
of fier, some thinke of aier, and some of the starres and other celestiall
powers. But if they be celestiall, then (as Peter Martyr ■=,2l\X}l\) must
they follow the circular motion : and if they be elementarie, then
must they follow the motions of those elements, of which their bodies
consist. Of aier they cannot be : for aier is Corpus homogeninm ; so
as everie part of aier is aier, whereof there can be no distinct members
made. For an organicall bodie must have bones, sinewes, veines,
flesh, &c : which cannot be made of aier. Neither (as Peter Martyr
affirmeth) can an aierie bodie receive or have either shape or figure.
But some ascend up into the clouds, where they find (as they
saie) diverse shapes and formes even in the aier. Unto
which objection P. Martyr answereth, saieng,
and that trulie, that clouds are not
altogether aier, but have a mix-
ture of other elements
mingled with
them.

Certeitie popish reasons cojicernitig spirits jnade 0 aier, of daie divels
and night divels, and why the divell loveth no salt in his ?neate.

I ANIE affirme (upon a fable cited hy M. Mai.) that spirits
are of aier, bicause they have beene cut (as he saith) in
sunder, and closed presentlie againe ; and also bicause
they vanish awaie so suddenlie. But of such apparitions
I have alreadie spoken, and am shortlie to saie more, which are
rather scene in the imagination of the weake and diseased, than in
veritie and truth. Which sights and apparitions, as they have beene
common among the unfaithfull ; so now, since the preaching of the
gospell they are most rare. And as among faintharted people ;
namelie, women, children, and sicke folkes, they usuallie swarmed ;
so among strong bodies and good stomachs they never used to
appeare ; as elsewhere I have prooved : which argueth that they
were onelie phantasticall and imaginarie. Now saie they that imagine
divels and spirits to be made of aier, that it must needs be that they
consist of that element ; bicause otherwise when they vanish sudden-
lie awaie, they should leave some earthie substance behind them.
If they were of water, then should they moisten the place where
they stand, and must needs be shed on the floore. If they consisted
of fier, then would they burne anie thing that touched them : and

Gen. 18, 10. yet (saie they) Abraham and Lot washed their feete, and were neither

scalded nor burnt.

y. Bod. lib. dc I find it not in the Bible, but in Bodin., that there are daie divels,

d<fm.i.ca.^. ^j.jj night divels. The same fellow saith, that Deber is the name of
that divell, which hurteth by night ; and Cheleb is he that hurteth by
daie : howbeit, he confesseth that Sathan can hurt both by daie and
by night ; although it be certeine (as he saith) that he can doo more
harme by night than by daie ; producing for example, how in a night
^18. he slew the first borne of JLgypt.l And yet it appeareth plainelie i

Kxod. 12 ;9. the text, that the Lord himselfe did it. Whereby it seemeth, that
Bodin putteth no difference betweene God and the divell. For further
confirmation of this his foolish assertion, that divels are more valiant

Psa. 104. 2Q. by night than by daie, he alledgeth the 104. Psaline, wherein is

written, Thou makest darknesse, and it is night, wherein all the
beasts of the forrest creepe foorth, the lions rore, &c : when the
sunne riseth, they retire, &c. So as now he maketh all beasts to be
divels, or divels to be beasts. Oh barbarous blindnes I This Bodin

abusing the scriptures, which he is not ashamed to quote in that i-evit. i.

capacities to conceive what maner of thing the divell is, by the verie
names appropriated unto him in the same.

That such divels as are )nentioned in the scriptures, have in their
names their nature and qualities expressed, with instancies
thereof.

UCH divels as are mentioned in the scriptures by name,
have in their names their nature and qualities expressed,
being for the most part the idols of certeine nations
idolatrouslie erected, in steed, or rather in spight of God.
For Beelzebub, which signifieth the lord of the flies, bicause he
taketh everie simple thing in his web, was an idol or oracle erected
at Ekron, to whom Ahaziah sent to know whether he should recover
his disease : as though thqre had beene no God in Israeli. This
divell Beelzebub was among the Jeeves reputed the principall divell.
The GrcEcians called him Pluto, the Latines Sumanus, quasi suntniuni
deortem inaniuni, the cheefe ghost or spirit of the dead whom they
supposed to walke by night : although they absurdlie beleeved also
that the soule died with the bodie. So as they did put a difference
betweene the ghost of a man and the soule of a man : and so doo
our papists ; howbeit, none otherwise, but that the soule is a ghost,
when it walketh on the earth, after the dissolution of the bodie, or
appeareth to anie man, either out of heaven, hell, or purgatorie, and
not otherwise. ^ iVisroch signifieth a delicate tentation, and was
worshipped by Senacherib in Assyria. ^Tarcat* is in English, fettered,
and was the divell or idoll of the Hevites. "-'' Beelphegor, otherwise
called Priapus, the gaping or naked god was worshipped among the
Moabits. ^ Adranielech, that is, the cloke or power of the king, was
an idoll at Sepharvais, which was a citie of the Assyrians. ^Chainos,
that is feeling, or departing, was worshipped among the Moabits.
^ Dagon, that is, corne or greefe, was the idoll of the Philistines.
8 Astarte, that is, a fold or flocke, is the name of a shee idoll at
Sydotiia, whom Salomon worshipped : some thinke it was I'erns.

'' Melchom, that is, a king, was an idoll or divell, which the sonnes of
Amnion worshipped.

Sometimes also we find in the scriptures, that divels and spirits
take their names of wicked men, or of the houses or stats of abhom-
inable persons : as Asiaroth^ which {a.s Josephus saith) was the idoll
of tlie Philistines, whome the Jeives tooke from them at Salomons
commandement, and was also worshipped of Salomon. Which
though it signifie riches, flocks, &c : yet it was once a citie belonging
to Og the king of Basan, where they saie the giants dwelt. In these
respects Astaroth is one of the speciall divels named in Salomo7is
conjuration, and greatlie emploied by the conjurors. I have suffici-
entlie prooved in these quotations, that these idols are Dii getttium,
the gods of the Gentiles : and then the prophet David may satisfie
you, that they are divels, who saith Dii gentitcm dcemonia stoit, The
gods of the Gentiles are divels. What a divell was the rood of grace
to be thought, but such a one as before is mentioned and described,
who tooke his name of his courteous and gratious behaviour towards
his worshippers, or rather those that offered unto him.'' The idolatrous
knaverie wherof being now bewraied, it is among the godlie reputed
a divell rather than a god : and so are diverse others of the same
stampe.

T hath also pleased GOD to informe our weake capacities,
as it were by similitudes and examples, or rather by com-
parisons, to understand what manner of thing the divell
is, by the verie names appropriated and attributed unto
him in the scriptures : wherein sometimes he is called by one name,
sometimes by another, by metaphors according to his conditions.
^ Elephas is called in Job, Behemoth, which is, Brttta ; whereby the
greatnes and brutishnes of the divell is figured. Leviathati is not
much different from Elephas ; whereby the divels great subtiltie and
power is shewed unto us. ^ Manunon is the covetous desire of monie,
wherewith the divell overcommeth the reprobate. '^ Dcemon signifieth
one that is cunning or craftie. Cacodcemon is perverslie knowing.

called. ^Diabohis is Calumniator, an accuser, or a slanderer. Sathan

ND for so much as the idols of the gentiles are called Psaim.96
divels, and are among the unlearned confounded and
intermedled with the divels that are named in the scrip-
tures ; I thought it convenient here to give you a note of
them, to whome the Gentiles gave names, according to the offices
unto them assigned. Penates are the domesticall gods, or rather
divels that were said to make men live quietlie within doores. But
some thinke these rather to be such, as the Gentiles thought to be
set over kingdomes : and that Lares are such as trouble private
houses, and are set to oversee crosse waies and cities. Larvce are
said to be spirits that walke onelie by night. Genii are the two
angels, which they supposed were appointed to wait upon each man.
Manes are the spirits which oppose themselves against men in the
waie. Dcenwnes were feigned gods by poets, as Jitpiter, funo, &c.
Viriinculi tej-rei are such as was Robin good fellowe, that would Cousening

to make them laugh, with tumbling, juggling, and such like toies.
Viriinciili are dwarfes about three handfulles long, and doo no hurt ;
but seeme to dig in mineralles, and to be verie busie, and yet doo
nothing. Guteli or Trulli are spirits (they saie) in the likenes of
women, shewing great kindnesse to all men : & hereof it is that we
call light women, truls. Dcenwnes niontani are such as worke in the
mineralles, and further the worke of the labourers woonderfullie, who
are nothing afraid of them. Hudgin is a verie familiar divell, which
will doo no bodie hurt, except he receive injurie : but he cannot abide
that, nor yet be mocked : he talketh with men freendlie, sometimes
visiblie, and sometimes invisiblie. There go as manie tales upon
this Hudgin, in some parts of Gerinanii', as there did in Eiigland of
Robin good fellowe. But this Hudgin was so called, bicause he
alwales ware a cap or a hoodt ; and therefore I thinke it was Robin
hood. Frier Rush was for all the world such another fellow as this
Hudgin, and brought up even in the same schoole ; to wit, in a
kitchen: in so much as the selfe-same tale is written of the one as of
the other, concerning the skullian, which is said to have beene slaine,
&c : for the reading whereof I referre you to Frier Rush his storie,
or else to John IVierus De Pfcesfigiis dcEnioftum.

There were also Familiares dannones, which we call familiars : such
as Socrafes and Casar were said to have ; and such as Feats sold to
doctor Burcot. Quititus Sertorius had Diana hir selfe for his fami-
liar ; and Numa Pompilius had Aegeria : but neither the one nor
the other of all these could be preserved by their familiars from
being destroied with untimelie death. Simon Samareus boasted,
that he had gotten by conjuration, the soule of a little child that was
slaine, to be his familiar, and that he told him all things that were
to come, &c. I marvell what privilege soules have, which are de-
parted from the bodie, to know things to come more than the soules
within mans bodie. There were spirits, which they called Albce
mulieres, and Alber Silylla;, which were verie familiar, and did much
harme (they saie) to women with child, and to sucking children.
Deuinus as a divell is worshipped among the Indians in Calecute, who
(as they thinke) hath power given him of God to judge the earth, &c:
his image is horriblie pictured in a most ouglie shape. Thevet saith,
that a divell in America, called Agnan, beareth swaie in that countrie.
In Gintiie one Grigrie is accounted the great divell, and keepeth the

prophesie. For the true successe whereof the people praie all the
while that he lieth groveling like a lecherous knave. There are a
thousand other names, which they saie are attributed unto divels ;
and such as they take to themselves are more ridiculous than the
names that are given by others, which have more leasure to devise
them. In litle bookes conteining the cousening possessed, at Looke in
Maidstone., where such a woonder was wrought, as also in other {oi^xlh. 7.

The xxii. Chapter.

Of the Romanes cheefe gods called Dii selecti, and of other
heathen gods, their nntnes and offices.

HERE were among the Romans twentie idolatrous gods,
which were called Dii selecii sive electi, chosen gods ;
whereof twelve were male, and eight female, whose
names doo thus foUowe : Janus, SatJtrmes, Jupiter,
Genius, Mercurius, Apollo, Mars, Vulcanics, Neptiimis, Sol, Orcus
and *Vidar, which were all hee gods : Tellus, Ceres, Juno, Minerva, [*zi<»]
Luna, Diana, Venus, and Vesta, were all she gods. No man might
appropriate anie of these unto himselfe, but they were left common
and indifferent to all men dwelling in one realme, province, or
notable citie. These heathen gentiles had also their gods, which
served for sundrie purposes ; as to raise thunder, they had Statores,
Tonantes, Feretrii, and Jupiter Elicius, They had Cantius, to A sood god
whome they praied for wise children, who was more apt for this dessffor
purpose than Minerva that issued out of Jupiters owne braine. women.
Lucina was to send them that were with child safe deliverie, and in
that respect was called the mother of childwives. Opis was called
the mother of the babe new borne, whose image women with child
hanged upon their girdles before their bellies, and bare it so by the ^24.
space of nine moneths ; and the midwife alwaies touched the child
therewith, before she or anie other laied hand thereon.

If the child were well borne, they sacrificed therunto, although the
mother miscaried : but if the child were in any part unperfect, or
dead,_&c : they used to beate the image into powder, or to burne or
drowne it. luigianus was he that kept their children from crieng, and The names

their children from misfortune in the cradell. Runiinus was to keepe
their dugs from corruption. Volumnus and his wife Volunma were
gods, the one for yoong men, the other for maids that desired
marriage : for such as praied devoutlie unto them, should soone be
married. Agreslts was the god of the fields, and to him they praied
for fertilitie. Bellus was the god of warre & warriers, and so also
was Victoria, to whome the greatest temple in Ronie was built.
Honorius was he that had charge about inkeepers, that they should
well intreat pilgrimes. Berecynthia was the mother of all the gods.
Aescttlanus was to discover their mines of gold and silver, and to him
they praied for good successe in that behalfe, Aesciilapitis was to
cure the sicke, whose father was Apollo, and served to keepe weeds
out of the corne. Segacia was to make seeds to growe. Flora pre-
served the vines from frosts and blasts. Sylvanus was to preserve
them that walked in gardens. Bacchus was for droonkards, Pavor
for cowherds ; Meretrix for whores, to whose honour there was
a temple built in Rome, in the middest of fortie and foure streets,
which were all inhabited with common harlots. Finallie Colatina,
*alias Clotina, was goddesse of the stoole, the jakes, and the privie,
to whome as to everie of the rest, there was a peculiar temple edified:
besides that notable temple called Pantheoji, wherein all the gods
were placed togither ; so as everie man and woman, according to their
follies and devotions, might go thither and worship what gods they
list.

The Aegyptians worshipped Anubis in the likenesse of a dog, bicause
he loved dogs and hunting. Yea they worshipped all living creatures,
as namelie of beasts, a bullocke, a dog, & a cat ; of flieng fowles,
Ibis (which is a bird with a long bill, naturallie devouring up venem-
ous things and noisome serpents) and a sparrowhawke ; of fishes
they had two gods ; to wit, Lepidotus piscis, and Oxyrinchns. The
Saitans and Thcbans had to their god a sheepe. In the citie Lyco-
polis they worshipped a woolfe ; in Herinopolis, the Cynocephalus ;
the Leopolitans, a lion ; in Lcetopolis, a fish in Niltis called Lalus.

In the citie Cytiopolis they worshipped Anubis. At Babylon, besides
Memphis, they made an onion their god ; the Tiebans an eagle ; the
Mceiideseans, a goate ; the Persiajis, a fier called Orimasda ; the
Arabians, Bacchus, Vemts, and Diasaren ; the Bceotians, Aniphia-
raus ; the Aphricans, Mopstcs ; the Scithians, Minerva ; the Nau-
cratiis, Serapis, which is a serpent ; Astartes (being as Cicero writeth
the fourth Venus, who was she, as others affirme, whom Salomoti
worshipped at his concubines request) was the goddesse of the
Assyrians. At Norictnii, being a part of Bavaria, they worship
Tibilenus ; the Moores worship Jtcba ; the Macedonians, Gabirus ;
the Po37iians, Uranius ; at Sainos Juno was their god ; at Paphos,
Venus ; at Lemnos, Vulcane ; at Naxos, Liberus ; at Lanipsacke,
Priapus with the great genitals, who was set up at Hellespont to be
adored. In the ile Dioniedea, Diomedes ; at Delphos, Apollo; at
Ephesus, Diana was worshipped. And bicause they would plaie
small game rather than sit out, they had Acharus Cyrenaicus, to
keepe them from flies and flieblowes ; Herctiles Canopius, to keepe
them from fleas ; Apollo Parnopeius, to keepe their cheefes from
being mouseaten. The Greeks were the first, that I can learne to
have assigned to the gods their principall kingdomes and offices : as
Jupiter to rule in heaven, Pluto in hell, Neptune in the sea, &c. To
these they joined, as assistants, divers commissioners ; as X.Q Jupiter,
Saturne, Mars, Vemts, Mercurie, and Minerva : to Neptune, Nereus,
&^c. Tutilina was onelie a mediatrix to Jupiter, not to destroie corne
with thunder or tempests, before whom they usuallie lighted candels
in the temple, to appease the same, according to the popish custome
in these daies. But I may not repeate them all by name, for the
gods of the gentiles were by good record, as Varro and others
report, to the number of 30. thousand, and upward. Whereby the
reasonable reader may judge their superstitious blindnesse.

32^. heretofore, or at this present time : for I dare undertake, that

some part of Italic. Had not everie citie in all the popes dominions

that S. Martine might be opposed to Bacchus ? If S. Martine be too

as long Meg was as verie a whoore as the best of them, she had

wrong that she was not also canonized, and put in as good credit as they :

for she was a gentlewoman borne ; whereunto the pope hath great

respect in canonizing of his saints. For (as I have said) he canonizeth

the rich for saints, and burneth the poore for witches. But I doubt

not, Magdalen, and manie other godlie women are verie saints in

heaven, and should have beene so, though the pope had never canonized

them : but he dooth them wrong, to make them the patronesses of

harlots and strong strumpets.

ours. Our painters had Luke, our weavers had Steven, our millers J28.
had Arnold, our tailors had Goodman, our sowters had Crispine, our
potters had S. Core with a divell on his shoulder and a pot in his hand.
Was there a better horseleech among the gods of the Gentiles than
S. Loyl Or a better sowgelder than S. Anthonie"^ Or a better
toothdrawer than S. Apolline ? I beleeve that Apollo Parnopehis was
no better a ratcatcher than S. Gertrude, who hath the popes patent
and commendation therefore. The Tliebans had not a better shepherd
than S. Wendeline, nor a better gissard to keepe their geese than
Callus. But for physicke and surgerie, our idols exceeded them all. F'or
S. John, and S. Valentine excelled at the falling evill, S. Roch was
good at the plague, S. Petronill at the ague. As for S. Margaret, she
passed Lucma for a midwife, and yet was but a maid : in which
respect S. Marpurge is joined with hir in commission.

For mad men, and such as are possessed with divels, S. Romane
was excellent, & frier Ruffine was also pretilie skilfull in that art. For
botches and biles, Cosnius and Daniian ; S. Clare for the eies, S.
Apolline for teeth, S. Job for the * pox. And for sore brests S. Agatha
was as good as Ruminus. Whosoever served Scrvatius well, should
be sure to loose nothing : if Servatius failed in his office, S. Vinden
could supplie the matter with his cunning ; for he could cause all things
that were lost to be restored againe. But here laie a strawe for a
while, and I will shew you the names of some, which exceed these
verie far, and might have beene canonized for archsaints ; all the other
saints or idols being in comparison of them but bunglers, and bench-
whistlers. And with your leave, when all other saints had given over
the matter, and the saints utterlie forsaken of their servitors, they re-
paired to these that I shall name unto you, with the good consent of
the pope, who is the fautor, or rather the patrone of all the saints,
divels, and idols living or dead, and of all the gods save one. And
whereas none other saint could cure above one disease, in so much as
it was idolatrie, foUie I should have said, to go to Job for anie other
maladie than the pox ; nothing commeth amisse to these. For they
are good at anie thing, and never a-whit nice of their cunning : yea
greater matters are said to be in one of their powers, than is in all the
other saints. And these are they : S. mother Bungle, S. mother Paine, 329.

A comparison beliuecne the licatJieii and papists, touching their
exxnses for idolatrie.

ND bicause I know, that the papists will saie, that their
idols are saints, and no such divels as the gods of the
Gentiles were : you may tell them, that not onelie their
saints, but the verie images of them were called Divi.
Which though it signifie gods, and so by consequence idols or feends :
yet put but an () thereunto, and it is Divill in English. But they
will saie also that I doo them wrong to gibe at them ; bicause they
were holie men and holie women. I grant some of them were so, and
further from allowance of the popish idolatrie emploied upon them,
than greeved with the derision used against that abuse. Yea even as
silver and gold are made idols unto them that love them too well, and
seeke too much for them : so are these holie men and women made
idols by them that worship them, and attribute unto them such honor,
as to God onelie apperteineth.

The heathen gods were for the most part good men, and profitable
members to the commonwealth wherein they lived, and deserved fame,
&c : in which respect they made gods of them when they were dead ;
as they made divels of such emperors and philosophers as they hated,
or as had deserved ill among them. And is it not even so, and woorsse,
in the commonwealth and church of poperie.? Booth not the pope
excommunicate, cursse, and condemne for heretikes, and drive to the
bottomlesse pit of hell, proclaming to be verie divels, all those that
either write, speake or thinke contrarie to his idolatrous doctrine ?
Cicero, when he derided the heathen gods, and inveied against them
that yeelded such servile honor unto them, knew the persons, unto
whom such abuse was committed, had well deserved as civill citizens ;
and that good fame was due unto them, and not divine estimation.
Yea the infidels that honored those gods, as hoping to receive benefits
for their devotion emploied that waie, knew and conceived that the
statues and images, before whome with such reverence they powred
foorth their praiers, were stockes and stones, and onelie pictures of
those persons whome they resembled : yea they also knew, that the
parties themselves were creatures, and could not doo so much as the
papists and witchmongers thinke the Roode of grace, or mother
Bnngie could doo. And yet the papists can see the abuse of the
Gentils, and may not heare of their owne idolatrie more grosse and
damnable than the others.

The conceipt of the Jieathen aiid the papists all one in idolatrie,
of the counccll of Trent, a notable storie of a hangman
arraigned after he was dead and buried, dr'c.

[UT papists perchance will denie, that they attribute so
much to these idols as I report ; or that they thinke it so
meritorious to praie to the images of saints as is supposed,
affirming that they worship God, and the saints them-
selves, under the formes of images. Which was also the conceipt of
the heathen, and their excuse in this behalfe ; whose eiesight and
insight herein reached as farre as the papisticall distinctions published
by popes and their councels. Neither doo anie of them admit so
grosse idolatrie, as the councell of Trent hath doone, who alloweth J'"^ idoU-
that worship to the Rood that is due to Jesus Christ himselfe, and so cell of
likewise of other images of saints. I thought it not impertinent "^"''
therfore in this place to insert an example taken out of the Rosa-
rie of our Ladie, in which booke doo remaine (besides this) ninetie
and eight examples to this effect : which are of such authoritie in
the church of Ro)ne, that all scripture must give place unto them. 53^-
And these are either read there as their speciall homilies, or preached
by their cheefe doctors. And this is the sermon for this daie verba-
tim translated out of the said Rosarie, a booke much esteemed and
reverenced among papists.

A certeine hangman passing by the image of our Ladie, saluted Exemti-^.
hir, commending himselfe to hir protection. Afterwards, while he
praied before hir, he was called awaie to hang an offendor : but his
enimies intercepted him, and slew him by the waie. And lo a cer-
teine holie preest, which nightlie walked about everie church in the
citie, rose up that night, and was going to his ladie, I should saie to
our ladie church. And in the churchyard he saw a great manie dead
men, and some of them he knew, of whome he asked what the
matter was, &c. Who answered, that the hangman was slaine, and
the divell challenged his soule, the which our ladie said was hirs :
and the judge was even at hand comming thither to heare the cause,
& therefore (said they) we are now come togither. The preest
thought he would be at the hearing hereof, and hid himselfe behind But our la-
a tree ; and anon he saw the judiciall seat readie prepared and fur- him well
nishcd, where the judge, to wit Jesus Christ, sate, who tooke up his ^"""fjj''
mother unto him. Soone after the divels brou-'ht in the hangman >iiai read.

pinnioned, and prooved by good evidence, that his soule belonged to
381. them. On the other side, our ladie pleaded for the hangman, proov-
ing that he, at the houre of death, commended his soule to hir. The
judge hearing the matter so well debated on either side, but willing
to obeie (for these are his words) his mothers desire, and loath to doo
the divels anie wrong, gave sentence, that the hangmans soule should
returne to his bodie, untill he had made sufficient satisfaction ;
ordeining that the pope should set foorth a publike forme of praier
for the hangmans soule. It was demanded, who should doo the
arrand to the popes holines ? Marie quoth our ladie, that shall yon-
der preest that lurketh behind the tree. The preest being called
foorth, and injoined to make relation hereof, and to desire the pope
to take the paines to doo according to this decree, asked by what
token he should be directed. Then was delivered unto him a rose
of such beautie, as when the pope saw it, he knew his message was
true. And so, if they doo not well, I praie God we may.

A confutation of the fable of the hangman^ of manie other feined
and ridiculous tales and apparitions, with a reproof e thereof.

Y the tale above mentioned you see what it is to worship
the image of our ladie. For though we kneele to God
himselfe, and make never so humble petitions unto him,
without faith and repentance, it shall doo us no pleasure
at all. Yet this hangman had great freendship shewed him for one
point of courtesie used to our ladie, having not one dramme of faith,
repentance, nor yet of honestie in him. Neverthelesse, so credulous
is the nature of man, as to beleeve this and such like fables : yea,
to discredit such stuffe, is thought among the papists flat heresie.
And though we that are protestants will not beleeve these toies,
being so apparentlie popish : yet we credit and report other appear-
ances, and assuming of bodies by soules and spirits ; though they
be as prophane, absurd, and impious as the other. We are sure the
holie maide of Kents vision was a verie cousenage : but we can
credit, imprint, and publish for a true possession or historie, the
knaverie used by a cousening varlot at Maidstone ;* and manie other
such as that was. We thinke soules and spirits may come out of
heaven or hell, and assume bodies, beleeving manie absurd tales told
by the schoolemen and Romish doctors to that effect : but we dis-

credit all the stories that they, and as grave men as they are, tell us
upon their knowledge and credit, of soules condemned to purgatorie,
wandering for succour and release by trentals and masses said by a
popish preest, &c : and yet they in probabilitie are equall, and in
number farre exceed the other.

We thinke that to be a lie, which is written, or rather fathered upon
Luther ; to wit, that he knew the divell, and was verie conversant
with him, and had eaten manie bushels of salt and made jollie good
cheere with him ; and that he was confuted in a disputation with a
reall divell about the abolishing of private masse. Neither doo we
beleeve this report, that the divell in the likenes of a tall man, was
present at a sermon openlie made by Carolostadius ; and from this
sermon went to his house, and told his sonne that he would fetch
him awaie after a dale or twaine : as the papists saie he did in deed,
although they lie in everie point thereof most maliciouslie. But we
can beleeve Platina and others, when they tell us of the appearances
of pope Benedict the eight, and also the ninth ; how the one rode
upon a blacke horsse in the wildernesse, requiring a bishop (as I
remember) whome he met, that he would distribute certeine monie
for him, which he had purloined of that which was given in almes to
the poore, &c : and how the other was scene a hundred yeares after
the divell had killed him in a wood, of an heremite, in a beares
skinne, and an asses head on his shoulders, &c : himselfe saieng
that he appeared in such sort as he lived. And diverse such stuffe
rehearseth Platina.

Now bicause S. Ambrose writeth, that S. Anne appeared to Con-
stance the daughter of Coftstantine, and to hir parents watching at
hir sepulchre : and bicause Eusebiiis and Nicepliortis saie, that the
Pontaniian virgine, Origins disciple, appeared to S. Basil, and put a
crovvne upon his head, in token of the glorie of his martyrdome,
which should shortlie followe : and bicause Hierome writeth of Patties
appearance ; and Theodoret, of S. John the Baptist ; and Atlianasius,
oi Amnions, ^'c: manie doo beleeve the same stories and miraculous
appearances to be true. But few protestants will give credit unto
such shamefull fables, or anie like them, when they find them written
in the Legendarie, Festivall, Rosaries of our Ladie, or anie other
such popish authors. Whereby I gather, that if the protestant
beleeve some few lies, the papists beleeve a great number. This I
write, to shew the imperfection of man, how attentive our eares are
to hearken to tales. And though herein consist no great point of
faith or infidelitie ; yet let us that professe the gospell take warning
of papists, not to be carried awaie with everie vaine blast of doctrine:
but let us cast awaie these prophane and old wives fables. And

although this matter have passed so long with generall credit and
authoritie : yet manie * grave author's have condemned long since
all those vaine visions and apparitions, except such as have beene
shewed by God, his sonne, and his angels. Athanashis saith, that
soules once loosed from their bodies, have no more societie with
mortall men. Augustine saith, that if soules could vvalke and vibit
their freends, &c : or admonish them in sleepe, or otherwise, his
mother that followed him by land and by sea would shew hir selfe
to him, and reveale hir knowledge, or give him warning, &c. But
most true it is that is written in the gospell ; We have Moses and the
prophets, who are to be hearkened unto, and not the dead.

A confutation of Johannes Laurentius, and of manie others., main-
teining these fained and ridiculous tales and apparitions, and
what driveth them arvaie : of Moses and Helias appearance in
mount Thabor.

|URTHERMORE, to prosecute this matter in more words;
if I saie that these apparitions of soules are but knaveries
and cousenages ; they object that Moses and Helias
appeared in mount Thabor, and talked with Christ, in
the presence of the principall apostles : yea, and that God appeared
in the bush, &c. As though spirits and soules could doo whatsoever
it pleaseth the Lord to doo, or appoint to be doone for his owne
glorie, or for the manifestation of his sonne miraculouslie. And
therefore I thought good to give you a taste of the vvitchmongers
absurd opinions in this behalfe.

And first you shall understand, that they hold, that all the soules
in heaven may come downe and appeare to us when they list, and
assume anie bodie saving their owne : otherwise (saie they) such
soules should not be perfectlie happie. They saie that you may
know the good soules from the bad verie easilie. For a damned
soule hath a verie heavie and sowre looke ; but a saints soule hath
a cheerefull and a merrie countenance : these also are white and
shining, the other cole blacke. And these damned soules also maie
come up out of hell at their pleasure ; although Abraham made
Dives beleeve the contrarie. They affirme that damned soules walke
oftenest : next unto them the soules of purgatorie ; and most seldome
the soules of saints. Also they saie that in the old lawe soules did



Divels and spirits.



Chap. 28.



449



appeare seldome ; and after doomes dale they shall never be scene
more : in the time of grace they shall be most frequent. The walk-
ing of these soules (saith Michael Andr.) is a most excellent argu-
ment for the proofe of purgatorie : for (saith he) those soules have
testified that which the popes have affirmed in that behalfe ; to wit,
that there is not onelie such a place of punishment, but that they are
released from thence by masses, and such other satisfactorie works ;
whereby the goodnes of the masse is also ratified and confirmed.

These heavenlie or purgatoi'ie soules (saie they) appeare most

commonlie to them that are borne upon ember dales, and they also

walke most usuallie on those ember dales : bicause we are in best

state at that time to praie for the one, and to keepe companie with

the other. Also they saie, that soules appeare oftenest by night ;

bicause men may then be at best leasure, and most quiet. Also they

never appeare to the whole multitude, seldome to a few, and most

commonlie to one alone : for so one may tell a lie without control-

ment. Also they are oftenest seene by them that are readie to die :

as Trasilla sawe pope Foelix ; Urshte, Peter and Patele ; Galla

Roniana, S. Peter ; and as Alitsa the maid sawe our Ladie : which

are the most certeine appearances, credited and allowed in the church

of Rome : also they may be seene of some, and of some other in that

presence not seene at all ; as Ursine sawe Peter and Pattle, and yet

manie at that instant being present could not see anie such sight, but

thought it a lie: as I doo. Michael Andres as confesseth, that papists

see more visions than protestants : he saith also, that a good soule

can take none other shape than of a man ; marie a damned soule

may and dooth take the shape of a blacke moore, or of a beast, or of

a serpent, or speciallie of an heretike. The christian signes that

drive awaie these evil! soules, are the crosse, the name of Jesus, and

the relikes of saints : in the number whereof are holiwater, holie

bread, Agnus Dei, &^c. For Andrew saith, that notwithstanding

Julianus was an Apostata, and a betraier of christian religion : yet

at an extremitie, with the onelie signe of the crosse, he drave

awaie from him manie such evill spirits ; whereby

also (he saith) the greatest diseases and

sicknesses are cured, and the

sorest dangers

avoided.

The xxix. Chapter.

A confutation of assitnnng of bodies, and of the serpent that
seduced Eve.

HEY that contend so earnestlie for the divels assuming
of bodies and visible shapes, doo thinke they have a
great advantage by the words uttered in the third of
Genesis, where they saie, the divell entered into a serpent
or snake ; and that by the cursse it appeareth, that the whole dis-
pleasure of God lighted upon the poore snake onlie. How those
words are to be considered may appeare, in that it is of purpose so
spoken, as our weake capacities may thereby best conceive the sub-
stance, tenor, and true meaning of the word, which is there set downe
in the manner of a tragedie, in such humane and sensible forme, as
woonderfullie informeth our understanding; though it seeme contrarie
to the spirituall course of spirits and divels, and also to the nature
and divinitie of God himselfe ; who is infinite, and whome no man
ever sawe with corporall eies, and lived. And doubtles, if the serpent
there had not beene taken absolutelie, nor metaphoricallie for the
divell, the Holie-ghost would have informed us thereof in some part
of that storie. But to affirme it sometimes to be a divell, and some-
times a snake ; whereas there is no such distinction to be found or
scene in the text, is an invention and a fetch (me thinks) beyond the
compasse of all divinitie. Certeinlie the serpent was he that seduced
Eve : now whether it were the divell, or a snake ; let anie wise man
(or rather let the word of God) judge. Doubtles the scripture in
manie places expoundeth it to be the divell. And I have (I am sure)
one wiseman on my side for the interpretation hereof, namelie
Salojnoti ; who saith. Through envie* of the divell came death into
the world : referring that to the divell, which Moses in the letter
did to the serpent. But a better expositor hereof needeth not,
than the text it selfe, even in the same place, where it is written ;
I will put enmitie betvveene thee and the woman, and betweene
thy seed and hir seed : he shall breake thy head, and thou shalt
bruse his heele. What christian knoweth not, that in these words
the mysterie of our redemption is comprised and promised.'' Where-
in is not meant (as manie suppose) that the common seed of
woman shall tread upon a snakes head, and so breake it in
peeces, &c : but that speciall seed, which is Christ, should be
borne of a woman, to the utter overthrow of sathan, and to the




Divels and spirits. char. ?o. 451

redemption of mankind, whose heele or flesh in his members the
divell should briise and assault, with continual! attempts, and carnall
provocations, &c.



The XXX. Chapter.

The objection co7ice?'nt>ig the divels ass27ii}io- otke serpents
bodie answered.

HIS word Serpent in holie scripture is taken for the
divell : The serpent was more subtill than all the beasts Gen. 3, i.
of the feeld. It likewise signifieth such as be evill
speakers, such as have slandering toongs, also heretiks,
&c : They have sharpned their toongs like serpents. It dooth likewise Psai. 139, 4.
betoken the death and sacrifice of Christ : As Moses lifted up the Num. 8. & 9.
serpent in the wildernesse, so must the sonne of man be lifted up •'° "•3''4-
upon the crosse. Moreover, it is taken for wicked men : O yee
serpents and generation of vipers. Thereby also is signified as well '^''^"- ^3, ?3-
a wise as a subtile man : and in that sense did Christ himselfe use
it ; saieng, Be ye wise as serpents, &c. So that by this breefe Matt. 10, 16.
collection you see, that the word serpent, as it is equivocall, so like-
wise it is sometimes taken in the good and sometitnes in the evill
part. But where it is said, that the serpent was father of lies, author
of death, and the worker of deceipt : me thinks it is a ridiculous SS^-
opinion to hold, that thereby a snake is meant ; which must be, if the
letter be preferred before the allegoric. Trulie Calvines opinion is to J- C't-I- >'" <?.•-
be liked and reverenced, and his example to be embraced and
followed, in that he offerech to subscribe to them that hold, that the
Holie-ghost in that place did of purpose use obscure figures, that the
cleare light thereof might be deferred, till Christs comming. He saith idem ibid.
also with like commendation (speaking hereof, and writing upon this
place) that Moses doth accommodate and fitten for the understanding
of the common people, in a rude and grosse stile, those things which
he there delivereth ; forbearing once to rehearse the name of sathan.
And further he saith, that this order may not be thought of Moses his idem ibid.
owne devise ; but to be taught him by the spirit of God : for such
was (saith he) in those dales the childish age of the church, which idcvi ibid.
was unable to receive higher or profounder doctrine. Finallie, he
saith even h'ereupon, that the Lord hath supplied, with the secret
light of his spirit, whatsoever wanted in plainenes and clearenes of
externall words.

If it be said, according to experience, that certeine other beasts are

farre more subtill than the serpent : they answer, that it is not absurd
to confesse, that the same gift was taken awaie from him, by God,
bicause he brought destruction to mankind. Which is more (me
thinkes) than need be granted in that behalfe. For Christ saith not ;
386. Be yee wise as serpents were before their transgression : but, Be
wise as serpents are. I would learne what impietie, absurditie,
or offense it is to hold, that Moses, under the person of the poisoning
serpent or snake, describeth the divell that poisoned Eve with his
deceiptfull words, and venomous assault. Whence commeth it else,
that the divell is called so often, The viper, The serpent, &c : and
that his children are called the generation of vipers ; but upon this
first description of the divell made by Mosesi For I thinke none so
grosse, as to suppose, that the wicked are the children of snakes,
according to the letter : no more than we are to thinke and gather,
that God keepeth a booke of life, written with penne and inke upon
paper ; as citizens record their free men.

Familie of

0 the atrsse rehearsed Gen. 3. and that place rightlie expounded,
John Calvines opinion of the divell.

[HE cursse rehearsed by God in that place, whereby witch-
mongers labour so busilie to proove that the divell en-
tered into the bodie of a snake, and by consequence can
take the bodie of anie other creature at his pleasure, &c:
reacheth (I thinke) further into the divels matters, than we can com-
prehend, or is needfull for us to know, that understand not the waies
of the divels creeping, and is farre unlikelie to extend to plague the
generation of snakes : as though they had beene made with legs
before that time, and through this cursse were deprived of that
benefit. And yet, if the divell should have entred into the snake, in
maner and forme as they suppose ; I cannot see in what degree of
sinne the poore snake should be so guiltie, as that God, who is the
most righteous judge, might be offended with him. But although I
abhorre that lewd interpretation of the familie of love, and such
other heretikes, as would reduce the whole Bible into allegories : yet
(me thinkes) the creeping there is rather metaphoricallie or significa-
tivelie spoken, than literallie ; even by that figure, which is there
prosecuted to the end. Wherein the divell is resembled to an odious
creature, who as he creepeth upon us to annoie our bodies ; so doth



\



Divels and spirits. chap. 32. 453

the divell there creepe into the conscience of Eve, to abuse and

deceive hir : whose seed nevertheles shall tread downe and dissolve

his power and malice. And through him, all good christians (as

Calvine saith) obteine power to doo the like. For we may not ima- j. Cai. Ub. in-

gine such a materiall tragedie, as there is described, for the ease of j^^^' 'i"^ ''*'

our feeble and weake capacities.

For whensoever we find in the scriptures, that the divell is called,
god, the prince of the world, a strong armed man, to whome is given
the power of the aier, a roring lion, a serpent, &c : the Holie-ghost
mooved us thereby, to beware of the most subtill, strong and mightie
enimie, and to make preparation, and arme our selves with faith 540-
against so terrible an adversarie. And this is the opinion and coun- J- Cai. u. inst.
sell of Calvine, that we seeing our owne weakenes, & his force mani- ,3^" ' ''*' ^" '
fested in such termes, may beware of the divell, and may flie to God 387.
for spirituall aid and comfort. And as for his corporall assaults, or
his attempts upon our bodies, his nightwalkings, his visible appear-
ings, his dansing with witches, &c : we are neither warned in the
scriptures of them, nor willed by God or his prophets to flie them ;
neither is there anie mention made of them in the scriptures. And
therefore thinke I those witchmongers and absurd writers to be as
grosse on the one side, as the Saddiices are impious and fond on the
other ; which saie, that spirits and divels are onlie motions and
affections, and that angels are but tokens of Gods power. I for my
part confesse with Ajigustitie, that these matters are above my reach Aug.decura
and capacitie : and yet so farre as Gods word teacheth me, I will
not sticke to saie, that they are living creatures, ordeined to serve the
Lord in their vocation. And although they abode not in their first
estate, yet that they are the Lords ministers, and executioners of his
wrath, to trie and tempt in this world, and to punish the reprobate in
hell fier in the world to come.

Mine owne opinio7i and resolution of the tiature of spirits, and of
the divell, with his properties.

UT to use few words in a long matter, and plaine termes p. Mart, in
in a doubtfull case, this is mine opinion concerning this ^^f^)"'^'' ^"

bodies. For (as Peter Martyr saith) spirits and bodies
are by antithesis opposed one to another : so as a bodie is no spirit,

&, 10. ' poses. For in places, where it is written, that ''all the creatures of

c."sap.^i. God are good ; and againe, when God, in the creation of the world,

Apocai. 4. e sawe all that he had made was good : the divell is not comprehended

" I. Tim. 4, 4 . ° . ...

' Gen. I. within those words of commendation. For it is written that he was

f Gen. 8. 44. a ^ murtherer from the beginning, and abode not in the truth, bicause

there is no truth in him ; but when he speaketh a lie, he speaketh of

1 joh. 3. 8. his owne, as being a lier, and the father of lies, and (as John saith) a

^■^'' '''■ ' ■ sinner from the beginning. Neither was his creation (so farre as I

can find) in that weeke that God made man, and those other creatures

mentioned in Genesis the first ; and yet God created him purposelie

to destroie. I take his substance to be such as no man can by learn-

Edw. Dee- ing define, nor by wisedome search out. Af. Deerhig saith, that

r'ad'u'on Pditle himsclfe, reckoning up principalities, powers, &c : addeth,

[he 6."^ A cleere sentence (saith he) of Paules modestie, in confessing a holie

388. ignorance of the state of angels : which name is also given to divels

in other places of the scripture. His essence also and his forme is

so proper and peculiar (in mine opinion) unto himselfe, as he himselfe

cannot alter it, but must needs be content therewith, as with that

Eph. 6, 13. which God hath ordeined for him, and assigned unto him, as pecu-

M^tth.'zV liarlie as he hath given to us our substance without power to alter

the same at our pleasures. For we find not that a spirit can make a

bodie, more than a bodie can make a spirit : the spirit of God

excepted, which is omnipotent. Nevertheles, I learne that their

nature is prone to all mischeefe : for as the verie signification of an

i.Pet. 5. enimie and an accuser is wrapped up \n Satian a.nd Diabohis \ so

Idem ibid. dooth Christ himselfe declare him to be in the thirteenth oi Matthew.

And bicause it seemeth to be performed with some kind of authoritie,
I will saie no more for the confutation thereof, but referre you to the
booke it selfe ; whereto if nothing be added that may make to their
reproch, I dare warrant nothing is left out that may serve to their

And note how and what the witches confesse, and see of what
weight and importance the causes are ; whether their confessions be 543-
not woonne through hope of favour, and extorted by flatterie or
threats, without proofe. But in so much as there were not past
seventeene or eighteene condemned at once at S. Osees in the countie Ai s. Osees

A conclusion wherein the Spirit of spirits is described, by the illu-
7nination of which spirit all spirits are to be tried : with a con-
futation of the Pneumatomachi flatlie denieng the divinitie of
this Spirit.

[«[] in text.] irf^ p*%silOUCHING the manifold signification of this word [Spirit]*
I have elsewhere in this breefe discourse told you my
mind : which is a word nothing differing in Hebrue from
breath or wind. For all these words following ; to wit,
Spi}-iti(s, Ventus, Flatus, Halitiis, are indifferentlie used by the Holie-
ghost, and called by this Hebrue word H^l 'n the sacred scripture.
For further proofe whereof I cite unto you the words of Isaie ; For

isai. 30, 28. his spirit (or breath) is as a river that overfloweth up to the necke,

&c : in which place the prophet describeth the comming of God in
heate and indignation unto judgement, &c. I cite also unto you the

Zach. 6, 5. words of Zacharie ; These are the foure spirits of the heaven, &c.

Gen. 1, 2. Likewise in Genesis; And the spirit of GOD mooved upon the waters.

joh. 3, 8. 344. Moreover, I cite unto you the words of Christ ; The spirit (or wind)
bloweth where it listeth. Unto which said places infinite more might
be added out of holie writ, tending all to this purpose ; namelie, to
give us this for a note, that all the saiengs above cited, with manie
more that I could alledge, where mention is made of spirit, the
Hebrue text useth no word but one ; to wit, HI*! which signifieth
(as I said) Spiritum, ventum,flat7im, halitiini ; which may be Eng-
lished, Spirit, wind, blast, breath.

But before I enter upon the verie point of my purpose, it shall not
be amisse, to make you acquainted with the collection of a certeine
Schoole divine, who distinguisheth and divideth this word [Spirit]*
into six significations ; saieng that it is sometimes taken for the aier,

he saith, that of spirits there are two sorts, some created and some
uncreated.

A spirit uncreated (saith he) is God himselfe, and it is essentiallie
taken, and agreeth unto the three persons notionallie, to the Father,
the Sonne, and the Hohe-ghost personallie. A spirit created is a
creature, and that is Hkewise of two sorts ; to wit, bodilie, and bodi-
lesse. A bodilie spirit is also of two sorts : for some kind of spirit
is so named of spiritualnes, as it is distinguished from bodilinesse :
otherwise it is called Spiritiis a spirando, id est, dflando, of breathing
or blowing, as the wind dooth.

A bodilesse spirit is one waie so named of spiritualnes, and then
it is taken for a spirituall substance ; and is of two sorts : some
make a full and complet kind, and is called complet or perfect, as a
spirit angelicall : some doo not make a full and perfect kind, and is
called incomplet or unperfect, as the soule. There is also the spirit
vitall, which is a certeine subtill or verie fine substance necessarilie
disposing and tending unto life. There be moreover spirits natural],
which are a kind of subtill and verie fine substances, disposing and
tending unto equall complexions of bodies. Againe there be spirits
animall, which are certeine subtill and verie fine substances disposing
and tempering the bodie, that it might be animated of the forme,
that is, that it might be perfected of the reasonable soule. Thus
farre he. In whose division you see a philosophical! kind of pro-

otherwise would be uncleane, comfortlesse, hard, drie, and barren of

give him, shall never be more a thirst. Other places likewise there
be, wherein the holie spirit is signified by the name of water and
flood : as in the 13. of I saie, the 29. of Ezech.\\iQ 146. Psalme, &r=c.
The same spirit by reason of the force and vehemencie thereof is
termed fier. For it doth purifie and cleanse the whole man from top
to toe, it doth burne out the soile and drosse of sinnes, and setteth
him all in a flaming and hot burning zeale to preferre and further
Gods glorie. Which plainelie appeared in the apostles, who when
346. they had received the spirit, they spake fierie words, yea such words
as were uncontiollable, in so much as in none more than in them

mea sunt quasi ignis? Are not my words even as it were fier? This
was declared and shewed by those fierie toongs, which were seene
upon the apostles after they had received the holie spirit.

Moreover, this spirit is called annointing, or ointment, bicause that
as in old time preests and kings were by annointing deputed to their
office and charge, and so were made fit and serviceable for the same :
even so the elect are not so much declared as renewed and made apt
by the training up of the holie spirit, both to live well and also to

and all vaine sciences, prophane practises, deceitful! arts, and cir-
cumventing inventions ; such as be in generall all sorts of witchcrafts
and inchantments, within whose number are comprehended all those
wherewith I have had some dealing in this my discoverie ; to wit,
charmes or incantations, divinations, augurie, judiciall astrologie,
nativitie casting, alcumystrie, conjuration, lotshare, poperie which is
meere paltrie, with diverse other : not one wherof no nor all together
are able to stand to the triall and examination, which this spirit of
truth shall and will take of those false and evill spirits. Naie, they
shalbe found, when they are laid into the balance, to be lighter than 547-

integritie, and effectuall operation of this spirit, whose working as it
is manifold, so it is marvellous, and therefore may and is called the
spirit of spirits.

and irketh their eares either to heare or understand the truth ; of

which disease properlie the phariseis of old were, and the papists

that manie fall into the spirit of perversenes and frowardnes, into the

In summe, this word [Spirit] dooth signifie a secret force and
power, wherewith our minds are inooved and directed ; if unto holie
things, then is it the motion of the holie spirit, of the spirit of Christ
and of God : if unto evill things, then is it the suggestion of the
wicked spirit, of the divell, and of satan. Whereupon I inferre, by A question.
the waie of a question, with what spirit we are to suppose such to be

booke, or through credulitie addict themselves thereunto as unto
divine oracles, or the voice of angels breakeing through the clouds ?

^48. We cannot impute this motion unto the good spirit ; for then they
should be able to discerne betweene the nature of spirits, and not
swarve in judgement : it followeth therefore, that the spirit of blind-
nes and error' dooth seduce them ; so that it is no mervell if in the
alienation of their minds they take falsehood for truth, shadowes for
substances, fansies for verities, &c : for it is likelie that the good
spirit of God hath forsaken them, or at leastwise absented it selfe from
them : else would they detest these divelish devises of men, which
consist of nothing but delusions and vaine practises, whereof (I
suppose) this my booke to be a sufficient discoverie.

It will be said that I ought not to judge, for he that judgeth shalbe
judged. Whereto I answer, that judgement is to be understood of
three kind of actions in their proper nature ; whereof the first are
secret, and the judgement of them shall apperteine to God, who in
time will disclose what so ever is done in covert, and that by his just
judgement. The second are mixed actions, taking part of hidden and
part of open, so that by reason of their uncerteintie and doubtfulnes
they are discussable and to be tried ; these after due examination are
to have their competent judgement, and are incident to the magistrate.
393. The third are manifest and evident, and such as doo no lesse ap-
parentlie shew themselves than an inflammation of bloud in the bodie:
and of these actions everie private man giveth judgement, bicause
they be of such certeintie, as that of them a man may as well con-
[■'«.] elude, as to gather, that bicause the sunne is risen in the east, Ergo*

it is morning : he is come about and is full south, Ergo* it is high
noone; he is declining and closing up in the west. Ergo* it is evening.
So that the objection is answered.

Howbeit, letting this passe, and spirituallie to speake of this spirit,
which whiles manie have wanted, it hath come to passe that they
have prooved altogether carnall ; & not savouring heavenlie divinitie
have tumbled into worsse than philosophicall barbarisme : & these
be such as of writers are called Pneidnatoinachi, a sect so injurious to
the holie spirit of God, that contemning the sentence of Christ,
wherein he foretelleth that the sinne against the holie spirit is never
to be pardoned, neither in this world nor in the world to come, they
doo not onelie denie him to be God, but also pull from him all being,

j^p. and with the Sadduces mainteine there is none such ; but that under
and by the name of holie spirit is ment a certeine divine force, where-
with our minds are mooved, and the grace and favour of God whereby
we are his beloved. Against these shamelesse enimies of the holie
spirit, I will not use materiall weapons, but syllogisticall charmes. And

first I will set downe some of their paralogysmes or false arguments ;
and upon the necke of them inferre fit confutations grounded upon
sound reason and certeine truth.

Their first argument is knit up in this manner. The holie spirit is i- Objectio.
no where expresselie called God in the scriptures ; Ergo he is not tlire dooih
God, or at leastwise he is not to be called God. The antecedent of never call

of God in the fift of the Acts. Againe, the consequent is false. For » The first
although he were not expresselie called God, yet should it not ther- a r^fuVati-
upon be concluded that he is not verie God ; bicause unto him are on of the
attributed all the properties of God, which unto this doo equallie d'em^ &c.
belong. And as we denie not that the father is the true light, although
it be not directlie written of the father, but of the sonne ; He was the
true light giving light to everie man that cometh into this world : so
likewise it is not to be denied, that the spirit is God, although the
scripture dooth not expresselie and simplie note it ; sithence it
ascribeth equall things thereunto ; as the properties of God, the
works of God, the service due to GOD, and that it dooth inter-
changeablie take the names of Spirit and of God oftentimes. They
therefore that see these things attributed unto the holie spirit, and
yet will not suffer him to be called by the name of God ; doo as it

standing they confesse to be a creature reasonable and mortall.

The second reason is this. Hilarie in all his twelve bookes of the -• 9'^^^'^''°-,

persons. ^Hereunto I answer, that although Hilarie dooth not *n^^ver"'

to name the holie spirit, God, whom he denieth to be a creature, when '^- '^^ ^'''"'^'^
as notwithstanding betweene God and a creature there is no meane :
I will in good sooth saie what I thinke. I suppose that Hilarie, for
himselfe, thought well of the godhead of the holie spirit : but this
opinion was thrust and forced upon him of the Pneiunatoniacii, who
at that time rightlie deeming of the sonne did erwhiles joine them-
selves to those that were sound of judgement. There is also in the
ecclesiasticall historie a little booke which they gave Liberius a bishop
of Rome, whereinto they foisted the Nicene creed. And that Hilarie
was a frecnd of the Pnciimatoinachi, it is perceived in his booke De

syjiodis, where he writeth in this maner ; Nihil aittem ininini vobis
videri debet, fratres charissiini,&^e : It ought to seeme no wonder
unto you deere brethren, &c. As for the objection of the praiers of
the church called the collects, that in them the holie spirit is not
called upon by name : we oppose and set against them the songs of
the church, wherein the said spirit is called upon. But the collects
are more ancient than the songs, hymnes, and anthems. I will not
now contend about ancientnesse, neither will I compare songs and
collects togither ; but I say thus much onelie, to wit, that in the most
ancient times of the church the holie spirit hath beene openlie called
upon in the congregation. Now if I be charged to give an instance,
let this serve. In the collect upon trinitie sundaie it is thus said :
Almightie and everlasting God, which hast given unto us thy servants
grace by the confession of a truth to acknowledge the glorie of the
eternall trinitie, and in the power of the divine Majestie to worship
the unitie : we beseech thee that thorough the stedfastnesse of this
faith, we may evermore be defended from all adversitie, which livest
and reignest one God world without end. Now bicause that in this
collect, where the trinitie is expresselie called upon, the names of
persons are not expressed ; but almightie and everlasting God invo-
cated, who abideth in trinitie and unitie ; it doth easilie appeare
elsewhere also that the persons being not named, under the name of
almightie and everlasting God, not onelie the father* to be understood,
but God which abideth in trinitie and unitie, that is the father, the
Sonne, and the Holie-ghost.

A third objection of theirs is this. The sonne of GOD oftentimes
praieng in the gospels, speaketh unto the father, promiseth the holie
spirit, and dooth also admonish the apostles to praie unto the heaven-
lie father, but yet in the name of the sonne. Besides that, he pre-
scribeth them this forme of praier : Our father which art in heaven.
Ergo\ the father onlie is to be called upon, and consequentlie the
father onelie is that one and verie true God, of whome it is written ;
Thou shalt worship the Lord thy God, and him onelie shalt thou
serve.

* Whereto I answer first by denieng the consequent ; The sonne
praied to the father onelie, Ergo\ the father onlie is of us also to be
praied unto. For the sonne of GOD is distinguished of us both in
person and in office : he as a mediator maketh intercession for us to
the father : and although the sonne and the holie spirit doo both
togither receive and take us into favour with God ; yet is he said to
intreat the father for us ; bicause the father is the fountaine of all
counsels & divine works. Furthermore, touching the forme of
praieng prescribed of Christ, it is not necessarie that the fathers



Divels and spirits. chap. 34. 463

name shuld personallie be there taken, sith there is no distinction of
persons made: but by the name of father indefinitelie we understand
God or the essence of God, the father, the son, and the Holie-ghost.
For this name hath not alwaies a respect unto the generation of the
Sonne of God ; but God is called the father of the faithfull, bicause
of his gratious and free adopting of them, the foundation whereof is
the Sonne of God, in whom we be adopted : but yet so adopted, that
not the father onelie receiveth us into his favour ; but with him also
the Sonne and the holy spirit dooth the same. Therefore when we
in the beginning of praier doo advertise our selves of Gods good-
nesse towards us ; we doo not cast an eie to the father alone, but
also to the sonne, who gave us the spirit of adoption ; and to the
holie spirit, in whom we crie Abba, Father. And if so be that invo-
cation and praier were restreined to the father alone, then had the
saints doone amisse, in calling upon, invocating, and praieng to the
Sonne of God, and with the sonne the holy spirit, in baptisme, accord-
ing to the forme by Christ himselfe assigned and delivered.

Another objection is out of the fourth of Amos, in this maner. [Am. 4, 13]
For lo it is I that make the thunder, and create the spirit, and shew ^^2.
unto men their Christ, making the light and the clouds, and mounting 4 Objectio.

the Pneumatomachi contended that these words are to be understood
of the holie spirit.

*But Ambrose in his booke De spirit n sancto, lib. 2. cap. 7. doth *4- Answer.
rightlie answer, that by spirit in this place is ment the wind : for if this"piace
the prophets purpose and will had beene to speake of the holie spirit, signifieth
he would not have begunne with thunder, nor have ended with light
and clouds. Howbeit, the same father saith ; If anie suppose that
these words are to be drawne unto the interpretation of the holie
spirit, bicause the prophet saith. Shewing unto men their Christ ;
he ought also to draw these words unto the mysterie of the Lords
incarnation : and he expoundeth thunder to be the words of the
Lord, and spirit to be the reasonable and perfect soule. But the
former interpretation is certeine and convenient with the words of
the prophet, by whom there is no mention made of Christ ; but the
power of God is set foorth in his works. Behold (saith the prophet)
he that formeth the mountaines, and createth the wind, and declareth
unto man what is his thought, which maketh the morning darknesse,
and walketh upon the hie places of the earth, the Lord God of hosts
is his name. In this sort Sautes a right skilful! man in the Hebrew nothTm'w^

wind or to the Lords incarnation : yet doth it not follow that the
holie spirit is a creature ; bicause this word of Creating doth not
alwaies signifie a making of something out of nothing ; as Eusebius
in expounding these words (The Lord created me in the beginning of
his waies) writeth thus. The prophet in the person of God, saieng ;
Behold I am he that made the thunder, and created the spirit, and
shewed unto men their Christ : this word Created is not so to be
taken, as that it is to be concluded thereby, that the same was not
before. For God hath not so created the spirit, sithence by the same
he hath shewed & declared his Christ unto all men. Neither was it
a thing of late beginning under the sonne : but it was before all
beginning, and was then sent, when the apostles were gathered
togither, when a sound like thunder came from heaven, as it had
beene the comming of a mightie wind : this word Created being used
for sent downe, for appointed, ordeined, &c : and the word thunder
signifieng in another kind of maner the preaching of the gospels.
The like saieng is that of the Psalmist, A cleane hart create in me
O God : wherein he praied not as one having no hart, but as one
that had such a hart as needed purifieng, as needed perfecting : &
this phrase also of the scripture. That he might create two in one
new man ; that is, that he might joine, couple, or gather together,
&c.

Furthermore, the Pneiimatomachi by these testimonies insuing
endevor to proove the holie spirit to be a creature. Out oi John the
I. chap. By this word were all things made, and without it nothing
was made. Out of i. Cor. 8. Wee have one God the father, even he
from whome are all things, and we in him, and one Lord Jesus Christ,
through whome are all things, and we by him. Out of the i. Coloss.
By him were all things made, things in heaven, and things in earth,
visible and invisible, &c. Now if al things were made by the sonne,
it followeth that by him the holie spirit was also made.

* Whereto I answer, that when all things are said to be made by
the sonne, that same universall proposition is restrained by John
himselfe to a certeine kind of things : Without him (saith the evan-
gelist) was nothing made that was made. Therefore it is first to be
shewed that the holie spirit was made, and then will we conclude out
o{ John, that if he were made, he was made of the sonne. The
scripture doth no where saie that the holie spirit was made of the
father or of the sonne, but to proceed, to come, and to be sent from
them both. Now if these universall propositions are to suffer no
restraint, it shall follow that the father was made of the sonne : than
the which what is more absurd and wicked ?

Againe, they object out of MattJi. ii. None knoweth the sonne



Divels and spirits.

but the father, and none the father but the sonne ; to wit, of and by
himselfe : for otherwise both the angels, & to whomsoever else it
shall please the sonne to reveale the father, these doo know both the
father and the sonne. Now if so be the spirit be not equal! with the
father and the sonne in knowledge, he is not onelie unequall and
lesser than they, but also no God: for ignorance is not incident unto
God,

* Whereto I answer, that where in holie scripture we doo meete
with universal! propositions negative or exclusive, they are not to be
expounded of one person, so as the rest are excluded ; but creatures
or false gods are to be excluded, and whatsoever else is without or
beside the essence and being of God. Reasons to proove and con-
finne this interpretation, I could bring verie manie, whereof I will
adde some for example. In the seaventh oi John it is said ; When
Christ shall come, none shall knowe from whence he is : notwithstand-
ing which words the Jewes thought that neither God nor his angels
should be ignorant from whence Christ should be. In the fourth to
the Galathicuis ; A mans covenant or testament confirmed with
authoritie no bodie dooth abrogate, or adde anie thing thereunto.
No just man dooth so ; but tyrants and truce-breakers care not for
covenants. In John eight ; Jesus was left alone, and the vi^oman
standing in the middest. And yet it is not to be supposed that a
multitude of people was not present, and the disciples of Christ like-
wise ; but the word Solus, alone, is referred to the womans accusers,
who withdrew themselves awaie everie one, and departed. In the
sixt of Marke ; When it was evening, the ship was in the middest of
the sea, and he alone upon land : he was not alone upon land or
shore, for the same was not utterlie void of dwellers : but he had not
anie of his disciples with him, nor anie bodie to carrie him a ship-
boord unto his disciples. Manie phrases or formes of speeches like
unto these are to be found in the sacred scriptures, and in authors
both Greeke and Latine, whereby we understand, that neither univer-
sal! negative nor exclusive particles are strictlie to be urged, but to
be explaned in such sort as the matter in hand will beare. When as
therefore the sonne alone is said to know the father, and it is de-
manded whether the holie spirit is debarred from knowing the father;
out of other places of scriptures judgment is to be given in this case.
In some places the holie spirit is counted and reckoned with the
father and the sonne jointlie : wherefore he is not to be separated.
Else-where also it is attributed to the holie spirit that he alone dooth
know the things which be of God, and searcheth the deepe secrets
of God : wherefore from him the knowing of God is not to be ex-
cluded.

S3S. 'ihcy doo yet further object, that it is not convenient or fit for God
after the manner of suters to humble and cast downe himselfe : but
the hohe spirit dooth so, praieng and intreating for us with unspeake-
able. grones : Rom. 8. Ergo the holie spirit is not God.

* Whereto I answer that the holie spirit dooth praie and intreat, in
so much as he provoketh us to praie, and maketh us to grone and
sigh. Oftentimes also in the scriptures is that action or deed
attributed unto God, which we being stirred up and mooved by him
doo bring to passe. So it is said of God unto Abraham ; Now I
know that thou fearest God : and yet before he would have sacrificed
Isaach, God knew the verie heart of Abraham : and therefore this
word Cognovi, I know, is as much as Cogjioscerefed, I have made or
caused to know. And that the spirit to praie and intreat, is the same
that, to make to praie and intreat, the apostle teacheth even there,
writing that we have received the spirit of adoption, in whome we
crie Abba Father. Where it is manifest that it is we which crie, the
Holie-ghost provoking and forcing us thereunto.

Howbeit they go further, and frame this reason. Whosoever is
sent, the same is inferior and lesser than he of whome he is sent, and
furthermore he is of a comprehensible substance, bicause he passeth
by locall motion from place to place : but the holie spirit is sent of
the father and the sonne, John. 14, 15, & 16. It is powred foorth and
shed upon men, Acs. 10. Ergo the holie spirit is lesser than the
Father and the Sonne, and of a comprehensible nature, and conse-
quentlie not verie God.

* Whereto I answer first, that he which is sent is not alwaies lesser
than he that sendeth : to proove which position anie meane wit may
inferre manie instances. Furthermore, touching the sending of the
holie spirit, we are here to imagine no changing or shifting of place.
For if the spirit when he goeth foorth from the father and is sent,
changeth his place, then must the father also be in a place, that he
may leave it and go to another. And as for the incomprehensible
nature of the spirit, he cannot leaving his place passe unto another.
Therefore the sending of the spirit is the eternall and unvariable will
of God, to doo something by the holie spirit ; and the revealing and

jj6. executing of this will by the operation and working of the spirit.
The spirit was sent to the apostles ; which spirit was present with
them, sith it is present everie-where : but then according to the will
of God the father hee shewed himselfe present and powerfull.

Some man may saie ; If sending be a revealing and laieng open of
presence and power, then may the father be said to be sent, bicause
he himselfe is also revealed. I answer, that when the spirit is said to
be sent, not onlie the revealing, but the order also of his revealing is



Divels and spirits. chap. ,4 467

declared ; bicause the will of the father and of the sonne, of whom he
is sent, going before, not in time, but in order of persons, the spirit
dooth reveale himselfe, the father, and also the sonne. The father
revealeth himselfe by others, the sonne and the holie spirit, so that
his will goeth before. Therefore sending is the common worke of all
the three persons ; howbeit, for order of dooing, it is distinguished by
diverse names. The father will reveale himselfe unto men with the
sonne and the spirit, and be powerfull in them, and therefore is said
to send. The sonne and the spirit doo assent unto the will of the
father, and will that to be doone by themselves, which God will to be
doone by them ; these are said to be sent. And bicause the will of
the sonne dooth go before the spirit in order of persons, he is also said
to send the spirit.

Yet for all this they allege, that if the spirit had perfection, then 9; Objectio.

would he speake of himselfe, and not stand in need alwaies of anothers speakeiu
admonishment : but he speaketh not of himselfe, but speaketh what ""ife"'"'"
he heareth, as Christ expresselie testifieth Joiji. 16. Ej\^o he is un-
perfect, and whatsoever he hath it is by partaking, and consequentlie
he is not God.

* Whereto I answer, that this argument is stale : for it was objected * Th? 9. an-
by heretikes long ago against them that held the true opinion, as

Cyrill saith ; who answereth, that by the words of Christ is rather to Cyvili. lib. r^.
be gathered, that the son and the spirit are of the same substance- "■^'^"'- '" • 3
For, the spirit is named the mind of Christ, i. Cor. 2: and therefore he
speaketh not of his owne proper will, or against his will in whom and
from whom he is ; but hath all his will and working naturallie proceed-
ing from the substance as it were of him.

Lastlie they argue thus : Everie thing is either unbegotten or 10. Objec-
unborne, or begotten and created ; the spirit is not unbegotten,
for then he were the father ; & so there should be two without be- JJ.
ginning : neither is he begotten, for then he is begotten of the father,
and so there shall be two sonnes, both brothers ; or hee is begotten 399.
of the sonne, and then shall he be Gods nephue, than the which what
can be imagined more absurd ? Ergo he is created.

The spirit, bicause he proceedeth from thence, is not a creature :
and bicause he is not begotten, he is not the son ; but bicause he is
the meane of begotten and unbegotten, he shall be God, &c.

sect of heretikes too too injurious to the holie spirit, insomuch as
they seeke what they can, to rob and pull from him the right of his
divinitie; I will all Christians to take heed of their pestilent opinions,
the poison whereof though to them that be resolved in the truth it
can doo little hurt, yet to such as stand upon a wavering point it can
doo no great good. Having thus far waded against them, and over-
throwne their opinions ; I must needs exhort all to whom the reading
hereof shall come, that first they consider with themselves what a
reverend mysterie all that hitherto hath beene said in this chapter
concerneth ; namelie, the spirit of sanctification, and that they so
ponder places to and fro, as that they reserve unto the holie spirit
the glorious title of divinitie, which by nature is to him appropriate :
esteeming of these Pneicmatoniachi or Tkeomachi, as of swine, de-
lighting more in the durtie draffe of their devises, than in the faire
fountaine water of Gods word : yea, condemning them of grosser
ignorance than the old philosophers, who though they savoured little
of heavenlie theologie, yet some illumination they had of the holie
and divine spirit, marrie it was somewhat mistie, darke, lame and
limping ; neverthelesse, what it was, and how much or little soever it
was, they gave thereunto a due reverence, in that they acknowledged
and intituled it Aniviam 7?iiendi, The soule or life of the world, and
(as Nasatizeii witnesseth) tov tov vravTos vovv^ The mind of the uni-
versal!, and the outward breath, or the breath that commeth from
without. Porphyrie expounding the opinion of Plato, who was not
utterlie blind in this mysterie, saith that the divine substance doth
proceed and extend to three subsistencies and beings : and that God
is chieflie and principallie good, next him the second creator, and the
third to be the soule of the world : for he holdeth that the divinitie
doth extend even to this soule. As for Hermes Trisinegistus, he
saith that all things have need of this spirit : for according to his
worthinesse he supporteth all, he quickeneth and susteineth all, and
he is derived from the holie fountaine, giving breath and life unto
all, and evermore remaineth continuall, plentifull, and unemptied.

And here by the waie I give you a note woorth reading and con-
sidering ; namelie, how all nations in a manner, by a kind of heavenlie
influence, agree in writing and speaking the name of God with no
more than foure letters. As for example, the A£gyptians doo call
him Tlieut, the Persians call him Syre, ihe Jewes expresse his un-
speakable name as well as they can by the word Adonai consisting
of foure vowels ; the Arabians call him Alia, the MaJionietists call
him Abdi, the Greekes call him Theos, the Latines call him Dens, &^c.
This, although it be not so proper to our present purpose, yet (be-
cause we are in hand with the holie spirits deitie) is not altogether



Divels and spirits. ciwp. 34. 469

impertinent. But why GOD would have his name as it were uni-

versallie bounded within the number of foure letters, I can give

sundrie reasons, which require too long a discourse of words by

digression : and therefore I will conceale them for this time. These

opinions of philosophers I have willinglie remembred, that it might

appeare, that the doctrine concerning the holie spirit is verie ancient ;

which they having taken either out of Moses writings, or out of the

works of the old fathers, published and set foorth m bookes, though

not wholie, fullie, and perfectlie understood and knowne : and also

that our Piieuniatomachi may see themselves to be more doltish in

divine matters than the heathen, who will not acknowledge that

essentiall and working power of the divinitie wherby all things are

quickened : which the heathen did after a sort see ; after a sort (I

saie) bicause they separated the soule of the world (which they also

call the begotten mind) from the most sovereigne and unbegotten JJp.

God, and imagined certeine differences of degrees, and (as Cyrill

saith) did Arrianize* in the trinitie. [-*Arianize]

So then I conclude against these Pneieina(oinachi, that in so much
as they imitate the old giants, who piling up Pelton upon Ossa, and Ovid. lib. mc-
them both upon OIy?npus^ attempted by scaling the heavens to pull ab's- dl-gi-
Jupiter ovX of his throne of estate, & to spoile him of his principalitie, |«"''*- ?^'-
and were notwithstanding their strength, whereby they were able to
carrie huge hilles on their shoulders, overwhelmed with those moun-
taines, and squized under the weight of them even to the death : so
these Pnetanatoinachi, being enimies both to the holie spirit, and no
freends to the holie church (for then would they confesse the trinitie
in unitie, and the unitie in trinitie, and consequentlie also the deitie
of the holie spirit) deserve to be consumed with the fier of his mouth,
the heate whereof by no meanes can be slaked, quenched, or avoided.
For there is nothing more unnaturall, nothing more monstrous, than
against the person of the deitie (I meane the spirit of sanctification)
to oppose mans power, mans wit, mans policie, &c : which was well
signified by that poeticall fiction of the giants, who were termed
A}ig!(tpedes, Snakefooted: which Sisjoachiinus Cavieraritis expoundeth
of wicked counsellors, to whose filthie persuasion tyrants doo trust as
unto their feete ; Txndi James Sadolct interpreteth of philosophers, who Jacob. Sadol.

assure these that there is Divina ultio due to all such, as dare in the
ficklenes of their fansies arreare themselves against the holie spirit ;
of whom sith they are ashamed here upon earth (otherwise they would
401. confidentlie and boldlie confesse him both with mouth and pen) he
will be ashamed of them in heaven, where they are like to be so farre
from having anie societie with the saints, that their portion shalbe
even in full and shaken measure with miscreants and infidels. And
^60. therefore let us, if we will discerne and trie the spirits whether they
be of God or no, seeke for the illumination of this inlightning spirit,
which as it bringeth light with it to discover all spirits, so it giveth
such a fierie heat, as that no false spirit can abide by it for feare of
burning. Howbeit the holie spirit must be in us, otherwise this pre-
rogative of trieng spirits will not fall to our lot.

But here some will peradventure move a demand, and doo aske
in loc. com. how the holie spirit is in us, considering that ?ifimti adfinitu7>i nulla

proportion ; neither can that which is unmeasurable be limited or
bounded within anie precinct of place, &c. I answer, that the most
excellent father for Christes sake sendeth him unto us, according as
Christ promised us in the person of his apostles ; The comforter
John. 14, ;6. (saith he) which is the holie spirit, whome my father will send in my
name. And as for proportion of that which is infinite to that which
is finite, &c : I will in no case have it thought, that the holie spirit is
in us, as a bodie placed in a place terminablie ; but to attribute
thereunto, as dulie belongeth to the deitie, an ubiquitie, or universall
presence ; not corporallie and palpablie ; but efilsctuallie, mightilie,

with all good gifts and excellent graces ;

we be not deceived.

Of Magical Circles, a7id Ihe rcaso7i of Iheir ItistiUition.

Vgitians, and the more learned sort of Conjurers, make imaginary
use of Circles in various manners, and to various in-
tentions. First, when convenience serves not, as to
time or place that a real Circle should be delineated,
they frame an imaginary Circle, by means of Incan-
tations and Consecrations, without either Knife, Pensil,
or Compasses, circumscribing nine foot of ground round about them,
which they pretend to sanctifie with words and Ceremonies, spattering
their Holy Water all about so far as the said Limit extendeth ; and
with a form of Consecration following, do alter the property of the
ground, that from common (as they say) it becomes sanctifi'd, and
made fit for Magicall uses.

Hotv to consecrate an imaginary Circle.

LEt the Exorcist, being cloathed with a black Garment, reaching to xhe form of
his knee, and under that a white Robe of fine Linnen that falls Consecration.
unto his ankles, fix himself in the midst of that place where he intends
to perform his Conjurations : And throwing his old Shooes about ten
yards from the place, let him put on his consecrated shooes of russet
Leather with a Cross cut on the top of each shooe. Then with his
Magical Wand, which must be a new hazel-stick, about two yards of
length, he must stretch forth his arm to all the four Windes thrice,
turning himself round at every Winde, and saying all that while with
fervency :

I who am the servant of the Highest, do by the vertiie of his Holy
Name Immanuel, sanctifie nnto my self the circjimference of nine foot

Which Ceremonies being performed, the place so sanctified is
equivalent to any real Circle whatsoever. And in the composition of
any Circle for Magical feats, the fittest time is the brightest Moon-light,
or when storms of lightning, winde, or thunder, are raging through the
air ; because at such times the infernal Spirits are nearer unto the
earth, and can more easily hear the Invocations of the Exorcist.

As for the places of Magical Circles, they ai^e to be chosen melan-
cholly, dolefull, dark and lonely ; either in Woods or Deserts, or in a
place where three wayes meet, or amongst ruines of Castles, Abbies,
Monasteries, &^c. or upon the Sea-shore when the Moon shines clear,
or else in some large Parlour hung with black, and the floor covered
with the same, with doors and windowes closely shut, and Waxen
Candles lighted. But if the Conjuration be for the Ghost of one
deceased, the fittest places to that purpose are places of the slain,
Woods where any have killed themselves. Church-yards, Burying-
Vaults, &^c. As also for all sorts of Spirits, the places of their abode
ought to be chosen, when they are called ; as Pits, Caves, and hollow
places, for Subterranean Spirits : The tops of Turrets, for Aerial
Spirits: Ships and Rocks of the Sea, for Spirits of the Water: Woods
and Mountains for Faries, Nymphs, and Satyres ; following the like
order with all the rest.

And as the places where, so the manner how the Circles are to be
drawn, ought to be perfectly known. First, for Infernal Spirits, let a
Circle nine foot over be made with black, and within the same another
Circle half a foot distant, leaving half a foot of both these Circles
open for the Magitian and his assistant to enter in : And betwixt these
Circles round about, write all the holy Names of God, with Crosses
and Triangles at every Name ; making also a larger triangle at one
side of the Circle without on this manner with
the names of the Trinity at the seven corners,
-viz. |9e^otDal&,t Huaft Bctrcsi^, immanur I, written
in the little circles.

The reason that Magitians give for Circles Q^ "^O

and their Institution, is, That so much ground

being blessed and consecrated by holy Words,

hath a secret force to expel all evil Spirits from the bounds thereof;

and being sprinkled with holy water, which hath been blessed by the

Master, the ground is purified from all uncleanness ; besides the holy
Names of God written all about, whose force is very powerful ; so
that no wicked Spirit hath the ability to break through into the Circle
after the Master and Scholler are entered, and have closed up the
gap, by reason of the antipathy they possesse to these Mystical
Names. And the reason of the Triangle is, that if the Spirit be
not easily brought to speak the truth, they may by the Exorcist
be conjured to enter the same, where by vertue of the names of the
Sacred Trinity, they can speak nothing but what is true and right.

But if Astral Spirits as Faries, Nymphs, and Ghosts of men, be
called upon, the Circle must be made with Chalk, without any Tri-
angles ; in the place whereof the Magical Character of that Element
to which they belong, must be described at the end of every Name.

must binde the head of an Owl, with a bundle of St. John's Wort.,

hangs, the Magitian must betake himself to the aforesaid place, at 12
a clock at night, and begin his Conjurations in this following nianner.

First, stretch forth the consecrated Wand towards the four corners
of the World, saying, By the mysteries of the deep, by the flames of
. Ufllial, by the poT.ver of the East, and the silence of the night, by the
holy rites of pjrrate,  conjure and exorcize thee thou distressed Spirit,
to present thy self here, and reveal nnto me the cause of thy Calamity,
why thou didst offer violence to thy owjt liege life, where tho7i art now
in bceing, and where thou wilt hereafter be.

Then gently smiting the Carcase nine times with the rod, say, 
conjure thee thotc spirit of this N. deceased, to anszver my demands
that I am to propound unto thee, as thou e7>er hopest for the rest of
the holy ones, and the ease of all thy misery ; by the blood of fesu
which he shed for thy soul, I conjure and bind thee to titter unto tne
what I shall ask thee.

Then cutting down the Carcass from the tree, lay his head towards
the East, and in the space that this following Conjuration is repeating,
set a Chafing-dish of fire at his right hand, into which powre a little
Wine, some Mastick, and Gum Aromatick, and lastly a viol full of the
sweetest Oyl, having also a pair of Bellows, and some unkindled Char-
cole to make the fire burn bright at the instant of the Carcass's rising.
The Conjuration is this :

 conjure thee thou spirit of N. that thou do immediately enter into
thy antient body again, and ans%ver to my demands, by the virtue of
the holy resurrection, and by the posture of the body of the Saviour of
the world, I charge thee, I conjure thee, I command thee on pain of
the torments and wandring of thrice seven years, which I by the
power of sacred Magick rites, have power to inflict tipofi thee ; by
thy sighs and groajts, I conjure thee to utter thy voice ; so help thee
God and the prayers of the holy Church. A men.

Which Conjuration being thrice repeated while the fire is burning
with Mastick and Gum Aromatick, the body will begin to rise, and at
last will stand upright before the Exorcist, answering with a faint and
hollow voice, the questions proposed unto it. Why it strangled it self ;
where its dwelling is ; what its food and life is ; how long it will be
ere it enter into rest, and by what means the Magitian may assist it to
come to rest : Also, of the treasures of this world, where they are
hid : Moreover, it can answer very punctually of the places where
Ghosts reside, and how to communicate with them; teaching the nature
of As 1 Spirits and hellish beings, so far as its capacity reacheth.

All which when the Ghost hath fully answered, the Magitian ought
out of commiseration and reverence to the deceased, to use what
means can possibly be used for the procuring rest unto the Spirit.

To which effect he must dig a grave, and filhng the same half full of
quick Lime, and a little Salt and common Sulphur, put the Carcass
naked into the same ; which experiment, next to the burning of the
body into ashes, is of great force to quiet and end the disturbance of
the Astral Spirit.

But if the Ghost with whom the Exorcist consulteth, be of one that
dyed the common death, and obtain'd the ceremonies of burial, the
body must be dig'd out of the ground at 12 a clock at night ; and the
Magician must have a companion with him, who beareth a torch in 218.
his left hand, and smiting the Corps thrice with the consecrated rod,
the Exorcist must turn himself to all the four winds, saying :

the Magician or whom he pleaseth, and transport into foreign
Countreys.

These three Spirits, though of various ranks and orders, are all
of one power, ability and nature, and the form of raising them
all is one. Therefore the Magician that desireth to consult with
either of these Spirits, must appoint a night in the waxing of the
Moon, wherein the Planet Mercury reigns, at ii a clock at night ;
not joyning to himself any companion, because this particular action
will admit of none ; and for the space of four dayes before the
appointed night, he ought every morning to shave his beard, and shift
himself with clean linnen, providing beforehand the two Seals of the
Earth, drawn exactly upon parchment, having also his consecrated
Girdle ready of a black Cats skin with the hair on, and these names
written on the inner side of the Girdle: ^a, §a ^ '^it, aate >^ ifPUtra

Upon his Shooes must be written Cctragratmnatoil, with crosses
round about, and his garment must be a Priestly Robe of black, with a
Friers hood, and a Bible in his hand.

When all these things are prepared, and the Exorcist hath lived
chastly, and retired until the appointed time : Let him have ready a
fair Parlour or Cellar, with every chink and window closed ; then
lighting seven Candles, and drawing a double Circle with his own
blood, which he must have ready before hand : let him divide the
Circle into seven parts, and write these seven names at the seven
divisions, setting at every Name a Candle lighted in a brazen Candle-
stick in the space betwixt the Circles : The names are these, (JTalloS ^

When this O-^nsecration is ended. Let him sprinkle the Circle with
consecrated Water, and with a Chafing-dish of Charcole, perfume it
with Frankincense and Cinamon, laying the Swords a cross the Circle,
and standing over them ; then whilest the fumigation burneth, let him
begin to call these three Spirits in this following manner :

This must be thrice repeated, and at the third repetition, the three

Spirits will either all appear, or one by lot, if the other be already

somewhere else imployed ; at their appearance they will send before

the Circle for the space of half a quarter of an hour ; after that more

hounds will come in, and after all, a little ugly A£thiop, who will take

the Hare from their ravenous mouths, and together with the Hounds

vanish ; at last the Magician shall hear the winding of a Hunts-mans

horn, and a Herald on Horseback shall come galloping with three

Hunters behind upon black Horses, who will compass the Circle

seven times, and at the seventh time will make a stand at the Northern

quarter, dismissing the Herald that came up before them, and turning

their Horses towards the Magician, will stand all a brest before him,

saying; @il pragma turtfjon marfiatan tJciinalft; to which the Magician

must boldly answer ; 13f ral, 13f roalli, CTorati^, ISf rmiel ; By the sacred rites

then alighting down will call their Herald to withdraw their Horses ;

The sacred Pentacles are as signs and charms for the binding of Pentacles.

order of the good Spirits opposite unto those evil ones whom the
Magitian is about to Invocate : And of sacred Pictures, Images, and
Mathematical Figures adapted to the names and natures of separated
Substances whither good or evil. Now the form of Consecrating such
Magical Pentacles is to name the vertue of the holy Names and
Figures, their Antiquity and Institution with the intention of the
Consecration purifying the Pentacle by consecrated fire, and waving
the same over the flames thereof

When the Exorcist would consecrate Places or Utensils, Fire or Utensils.
Water for magical uses, he must repeat the Consecration or Dedica-
tion oi Solomon the King at the building of the Temple, the Vision
oi Moses at the Bush, and the Spirit of the Lord on the tops of the
Mulberry-trees, repeating also the sacrifice of it self being kindled ;
the Fire upon Sodom, and the Water of Eternal Life : Wherein the
Magitian must still remember to speak of the seven golden Candle-
sticks, and E"ckiels Wheels, closing the Consecration with the deep
and mysterious Names of God and holy Daemons.

When particular Instruments are to be sanctified, the Magitian instruments.
must sprinkle the same with consecrated Water, and fumigate them
with fumigations, anoint them with consecrated Oyl : And lastly.
Seal them with holy Characters ; after all which is performed, an 221.
Oration or Prayer must follow, relating the particulars of the Conse-

Treatincr more practically of the Consecration of Circles, Fires,

IN the Construction of Magical Circles, the hour, day, or night,
and season of the year, and the Constellation are to be con-
sidered; as also what sort of Spirits are to be called; and to what
Region, Air, or Climate they belong : Therefore this method is to be
followed for the more orderly and certain proceeding therein. First,
a Circle nine foot over must be drawn, within which another Circle
three inches from the outermost must be also made, in the Center
whereof the name of the hour, the Angel of the hour, the Seal of the
Angel, the Angel of the day predominant, wherein the work is under-
taken. Note, these attributes are to be inscribed betwixt the Circles
round about yN\\}ci. Alpha at the beginning, and Omega at the close.

When the Circle is composed, it must be sprinkled with holy
Water, while the Magician saith. Wash tne O Lord, and I shall be
whiter then Snow : And as for the Fumigations over them, this Bene-
diction must be said ; O God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, bless
these thy siibservient creatures, that they may multiply the force of
their excelle7it odors, to hinder evil spirits afid phantasms from entring
the Circle, throtcgh our Lord. Amen.



Fire.



An Exorcism for the fire.

The Exorcist ought to have an earthen Censer, wherein to preserve
the fire for magical uses, and the expiations and fumigations, whose
consecration is on this manner.

of all, I exorcize and sanctifie thee thou creature of Fire, that imme-
diately thou banish every phantasin from thee, so that thou prove not
hurtful in any kind: Which I beseech thee O Lord to confirm by
sanctify iiig and making pure this creature of fire, that it may be blessed
and consecrate to the honour of thy holy Name. Amen.

Instructions before set down, are sufficient to direct the Exorcist ; on]""ng.
only the Acter and his Scholar must be mindful in the way, as they
go towards the place of Conjuration, to reiterate the sacred forms of
Consecrations, Prayers, and Invocations, the one bearing an Earthen
\'essel with consecrated fire, and the other the Magical Sword, the

When the Exorcist hath finished this Conjuration, he and his
companion shall continue constantly turning themselves to the East,
West, North and South, saying, with their Caps in their hands,
<5rrson, ainffe, llrpljaton, Uasaniia'^, CTabon ; and within a little space
they will behold various apparitions upon the ground, and in the air,
with various habits, shapes, and instruments ; after that, he shall
perceive a troop of armed men with threatning carriage appear before
the Circle, who after they are conjured to leave off their phantasms,
will at last present themselves before the Exorcist in humane form.

Then the Master must be mindful to take the consecrated Sword,
and the cup of Wine into his hands ; the Wine he shall pour into the
fire, and the Sword he shall brandish in his right arm, beipg girded
about with a Scarlet Ribbon ; after this the Magician sliall say,
CJafttrf , ©rpjna. S3nf pftc ratotx ; then the Spirits will begin to bow unto
the Exorcist, saying. We are ready to fulfil thy pleasure.

So that when the Magician hath brought the Spirits to this length,
he may ask what ever he desireth, and they will answer him, provided
the questions belong to that order whereof they are.

Now the properties wherein they excel, are these ; They can give
the gift of Invisibility, and the fore-knowledge of the change of
weather ; they can teach the Exorcist how to excite Storms and Tem-
pests, and how to calm them again ; they can bring news in an hours
space of the success of any Battle, Seidge, or Navy, how farr ofif soever;
they can also teach the language of Birds, and how to fly through
the air invisibly.

'Twas through the assistance of these airy Spirits, that Chanchian-
cungi, the Tartariajt Emperour did give the Chinois such a desperate
rout near the year 1646. for it is reported, that he had constantly in
his presence two Magicians, named Ran and Sionam, who perceived
every motion of the Chind?, Army, and had intelligence by these
Spirits of the Emperours private Counsels and Consultations.

And it is credibly reported by Magicians, that wonderful things may
be with facility effected through the assistance of these aforesaid
Spirits, so that the Exorcist must be very affable unto them, and
gently dismiss them (when he is satisfied) in this following manner ;

Seeing ye have willingly answered all our Interrogations and de-
sires, we give you leave and licence. In the Name of the Father, Son,

After all these Ceremonies are finished, the Spirits will begin to
depart, making obeysance as they go ; and then the Master must
demolish the Circle, and taking up all the Utensils repeat the Pater
Noster as they are going away from the place of Conjuration.



Chap. VII.

How to obtain the familiarity of the Genius or Good Angel, a)id
cause him to appear.



A



Ccording to the former Instructions in conjuring Spirits, How to con-
we must proceed to consult with the Familiars or Genii; \niiiariox'Gc-



first, after the manner prescribed by Magicians, the Exorcist
must inform himself of the name of his good Genius, which he may
find in the Rules of Travius and Philermus; as also, what Character
and Pentacle, or Lamin, belongs to every Genius. After this is done,
Let him compose an earnest Prayer unto the said Genius, which he
must repeat thrice every morning for seven dayes before the Invocation.

The Magician must also perfectly be informed to what Hierarchy
or Order the Genius belongs, and how he is dignified in respect of
his Superiours and Inferiours ; for this form of Conjuration belongs
not to the Infernal or Astral Kingdom, but to the Celestial Hierarchy;
and therefore great gravity and sanctity is herein required, besides
the due observation of all the other injunctions, until the time
approach wherein he puts the Conjuration in execution.

When the day is come wherein the Magician would invocate his
proper Genius, he must enter into a private closet, having a little
Table and Silk Carpet, and two Waxen Candles lighted ; as also a
Chrystal Stone shaped triangularly about the quantity of an Apple,
which Stone must be fixed upon a frame in the center of the Table ;
And then proceeding with great devotion to Invocation, he must
thrice repeat the former Prayer, concluding the same with Pater
Noster, &'c. and a Missaie de Spiritti Sancto.

Then he must begin to Consecrate the Candles, Carpet, Table and
Chrystal ; sprinkling the same with his own blood, and saying,  do

Which done, the Exorcist must say this following Prayer with his face
towards the East.and kneeling with his back to the consecrated Table.

O thou blessed ^tl^narl my Angel Guardian, vouchsafe to descend
•with thy holy hiflueiice and presence into this spotless Chrystal, that
1 7)iay behold thy glory and enjoy thy society O thou who art higher
224. then the fourth Heaven, aiid know'st the secrets of\ Crlancl. Thou that
ridcst upon the wings of the wind, and art mighty atid potent in thy
celestial and super-lunary motion, do thou descend and be present I
pray thee, and desire thee, if ever I have jnei-ited thy society, or if my
actions and intetitio7is be pure and sanctified before thee, bring thy
extertial presence hither, and converse with thy submissive Pupil, by
the tears of Saints afid Songs of Angels, In the Name of the Father,
Son, and Holy Ghost, who are one God for ever and ever.

This Prayer being first repeated towards the East, must be after-
wards said towards all the four winds thrice. And next the 70.
Psalm repeated out of a Bible that hath been consecrated in
like manner as the rest of the utensils ; which ceremonies being
seriously performed ; the Magician must arise from his knees, and
sit before the Crystal bare-headed with the consecrated Bible in his
hand, and the Waxen Candles newly lighted, waiting patiently and
internally for the coming and appearance of the Genius.

Now about a quarter of an hour before the Spirit come. There
will appear great variety of apparitions and sights within the glass ;
as first a beaten road or tract, and travelers, men and women march-
ing silently along ; next there will Rivers, Wells, Mountains and Seas
appear : after that a Shepherd upon a pleasant hill feeding a goodly
flock of Sheep, and the Sun shining brightly at his going down ; and
lastly, innumerable shews of Birds and Beasts, Monsters and strange
appearances, noises, glances, and afifrightments, which shews will all
at last vanish at the appearance of the Genius.

And then the Geni7cs will present it self amidst the Crystal, in the very
same apparel and similitude that the person himself is in, giving in-
structions unto the Exorcist how to lead his life and rectifie his doings.

But especially (which is the proper work of every Genius) he
will touch his heart and open his senses and understanding, so
that by this means, he may attain to the knowledge of every Art and
Science, which before the opening of his Intellect was lockt and kept
secret from him.

After which, the Genius will be familiar in the Stone at the Prayer
of the Magician.

David, he was in ferusaiem, or Saleti, being then under the
name of lorlilalft ; after that he came over with Julius Ccesar, and
remained some hundred of years in Cambria, or Wales, instructing
their Prophetical Poets in British Rhimes, being then surnamed
Urtliin-Wadd Elgin, from thence he betook himself unto this
Island, Anno 1500. and continued there for 50 years, after which
he resigned his Dominion to Balkin, and hath continued ever since
an attendant unto this Prince.

He is a Spirit of the Air in the order of (JUIauron, and is said to His office
procreate as mortals do; He is often sent by his Master upon errands
to Lapland, Finland, and Strik-finia ; as also to the most Northern
parts o{ Russia, bordering on the Northern frozen Ocean : His office
(being called by Magicians) is to demolish strong holds of Enemies,
destroying every night what they build the day before ; to extinguish
fires, and make their Gunshot that it hath no power to be enkindled ;
for his nature is to be at enmity with fire; and under his Master with
many Legions he wageth continual warrs with the fiery Spirits that
inhabit the Mountain Hecla in Ise-lajtd, where they endeavour to
extinguish these fiery flames, and the inhabiting Spirits defend the
flames from his Master and his Legions.

In this contest they do often totally extirpate and destroy one 225.
another, killing and crushing when they meet in mighty and violent Y^^^hl^^^ °^
Troops in the Air upon the Sea ; and at such a time many of the
fiery Spirits are destroyed, when the Enemy hath brought them off
the Mountain to fight upon the water ; on the contrary, when the
battle is on the Mountain it self, the Spirits of the Air are often
worsted, and then great mournings and doleful noises are heard both
in Iseland and Russia, and Norzuay for many days after.

and at last there will appear four little Dwarfs or Pigmies naked

Chap. IX.



How to Conjure the Spirit ISalfetn the Master ^TILurilran.

AS in the former Chapter, the Exorcist is instructed to draw
the form of the Mountain Hecla within the circle, so in this
form of Conjuration he must do the same, adding these
names to be written round the Mountain Mathiel \ Ka^uiliel, The names of
SrraplDifl .ii?i.'ttifl. tvayrl, .^frartcl. These are the names of Olympick ^Lgds!''''

belongs unto the Northern Climate ; so that the authority of these
names must be used in the calling up of this Spirit, because he is a
great Lord, and very lofty, neither will he appear without strong and
powerful Invocations.

Therefore the Magician must make upon Virgin Parchment the two
Seals of the Earth, and provide unto himself a Girdle made of a

ankles, and a new Sword with agla on the one side, and ©tl upon the
other ; having likewise been very continent and chast for three days
before the execution of his design : and when the appointed night
approacheth, he must take with him an earthen pan with fire
therein, and a little Viol with some of his own blood, as also some of
the Gum or Rozin that comes from the Firr-tree.

And coming to the appointed place in some solitary Valley, the
circle must be drawn with chalk, as the former, one circle within
another, and these powerful names in the circumference, ©tl^eos on

This Circumscription is accounted amongst Magicians of all the
most powerful and prevalent.

Sword and Blood must be consecrated according to the foregoing
forms of Consecration, adding also this to the end of the consecra-
tion.

this following manner :

Seth, and the Prayers ofHoah, by the voyces of Thunder and dreadful
day of Judgment ; by all these powerful and royal words abovesaid,
that without delay or malitious ititent, thou do come before me here at
the circumference of this cotisecrated Circle, to a7tswcr my proposals
and desires without any mangier of terrible form either of thy self, or
attendants ; but only obediently , fairly , and zvith good intent, to present
thy self before me, this Circle being my defence, through his power who
is Almighty, and hath sanctified the same, « the Name of the Father,
Son, and Holy Ghost. Amen.

After the Magician hath thrice repeated this Conjuration, Let him
immediately set the fire before him, and put the Rozin thereon to
fumigate at the appearance of the conjured Spirits, and at the instant
of their appearance he shall hold the Censer of fire in his left hand,
and the Sword in his right, still turning round as the Spirits do.

For in a little space after the Invocation is repeated, he shall hear
the noise of Thunders, and perceive before him in the Valley a mighty
storm of Lightning and Rain ; after a while the same will cease, and
an innumerable company of Dwarfs or Pigmies will appear mounted
upon Chamelions to march towards the Circle surrounding the same.

Next comes iSal&in with his Attendants ; he will appear like the
god Bacchus upon a little Goat, and the rest that follow will march
after him afoot.

Assoon as they come near the Circle, they will breath out of their
mouths a mist, or fog, which will even obscure the light of the Moon,
and darken the Magician, that he cannot behold them nor himself;
yet let him not be discomfited, or afraid, for that fog will be quickly
over ; and the Spirits will run round the Circle after Ualljiu their
Lord, who rides upon a Goat ; they will continue to surround the
Circle, till the Magician begin the form of obligation or binding their
Leader or King in this form, with the Sword in his right hand, the
Fire and Rozin burning before him.

 conjure and bind thee Balfetn, who art appeared before me, by the
Father, by the Son, and by the Holy Ghost, by all the holy Coisecra-
tions I haife made, by the powerful Names of Heaven, and of Earth,
arid of Hell, that I have used and tittered in calling upon thee, by the
Seals which thou here beholdest,and the Sword which I present'*' ujito [*sho\v, not

body, soul, or fortune ; but 07i the contrary, to aiiswer faithfully ujtto
my demands, and not hence to remove, till I have licenced thee to
depart, In the Name of the Father, Son, and holy Spirit. Amen.\
228. When he is thus obliged, he will alight from his Goat, and cause
his Attendants to remove further into the Valley, then will he stand
peaceably before the Circle to answer the Magician.

After this the Magician shall begin to demand into his own posses-
sion a Familiar to build or pull down any Castle or strong hold in a
night ; and that this Familiar bring with him the Girdle of Conquest,
or Victory, that the Magician being girded with the same may over-
come all enemies whatsoever.

And further, the Spirit is able to inform him of all questions
concerning Thunder and Lightning, the Motions of the Heavens, the
Comets and Apparitions in the air. Pestilence and Famine, noxious
and malevolent blasts, as also of the Inhabitants of the Northern Pole,
and the wonders undiscovered throughout the world.

Likewise if the Exorcist inquire concerning the habitations of starry
Spirits, he will readily answer him, describing their orders, food, life,
and pasttime truly and exactly.

After the Magician hath satisfied himself with inquiries, and curious
questions unto the Spirit, there will come fi'om amongst the company a
little Spirit of a span long, like a little Ethiop, which the great King
iijalfeill will deliver unto the Exorcist to continue as a Familiar with
him as long as his life shall last. This familiar the possessor may
[* as] name at* it pleaseth him.

The three last, who had this Spirit into possession, were three
Northern Magicians, the first Hondicros a N'orwegiafi, who called it
^fjilfliav, and commanded it at his pleasure with a little Bell.

After him Benno his eldest Son injoy'd the same under the same
name.

And Swarkzar a Polonian Priest was the last who enjoy'd it under
the Name of illluiicula ; all which names were imposed upon it,
according to the pleasure of the Masters ; and therefore the naming
of this familiar is left to the discretion of the Exorcist.

Now when the Master hath taken this familiar into his custody and
service, the Spirit iSalfeitt will desire to depart, being wearied if the
action continue longer then an hour. Therefore the Magician must
be careful to dismiss him in this following form :

Because thou hast diligently answered my demands, and been ready
to come at my first call, I do here licefice thee to depart ttnto thy proper
place, tvithout i?ijury or danger to ?nan or Beast ; depart, I say, and



of Witchcraft. chap. ix. 49 1

be ever ready at my call, being duly exorcised and co7ijiired by sacred
Rites of Magick ;  charge thee to withdraw with quiet atid peace ;
and peace be coitlnued betwixt me and thee, In the Name of the Father,
Son, and Holy Ghost. Amen.

Then the Spirits company will begin to march about their Prince,
and in a formal Troop will march along the Valley, whilest the Magi-
cian repeateth Pater N^oster,&^c. until the Spirits be quite out of sight
and vanished.

This is a compleat form of conjuring the aforesaid Spirit, according
to the Rules of Vaganosttis the Norwegian.

The reason of
this Addition.



The nature of
Spirits.




Of Spirits in General ; IVJiat they are and how to be consi-
dered : Also how farr the Power of Magitians aiid Witches
is able to operate in Diabolical Magick.

JEcause the Author in his foregoing Treatise, upon the
Nature of Spirits afid Devils, hath only touched the sub-
ject thereof superficially, omitting the more material part ;
and with a brief and cursory Tractat, hath concluded to
speak the least of this subject which indeed requires most amply to
be illustrated ; therefore I thought fit to adjoyn this subsequent
discourse ; as succedaneous to the fore-going, and conducing to the
compleating of the whole work.

2. The Nature of Spirits is variously to be considered, according
to the source to which each Caterva doth belong : for as some are
altogether of a divine and celestial nature ; not subject to the abom-
inable Inchantments and Conjurations of vitious mankind ; so others
are the grand Instigators, stirring up mans heart to attempt the
enquiry after the darkest, and most mysterious part of Magick, or
Witchcraft : neither is this their suggestion without its secret end :
that is, that by the private insinuation, and as it were incorporating
themselves into the affection, or desire of the Witch, or Magician ;
they may totally convert him into their own nature : reducing him at
last by constant practice, to such obdurateness and hardness of heart,
that he becometh one with them, and delighted with their association,
being altogether dead to any motions in himself that may be called
good.

3. And if we may credit example, which is the surest proof; the

very imaginations, and affection of a Magician, doth create an evil The original

Essence or Devil; which was not before in being: for, as the Astral "^ ^^'' '^^^^n'^".

Spirits are believed by many to Germinate and procreate one another

so likewise are the infernal Spirits capable of multiplication in their

power and essence, according to their Orders, Ranks and Thrones ;

by means of the strong imagination in a Witch, or malevolous person,

earnestly desiring their assistance.

4. Not that the Spirits or Devils so begotten do any whit add or Their Germi-
contribute to the number in general ; for as they are capable of "'i''""-
increasing into distinct and separated substances, so are they likewise

again contracted, and as it were annihilated ; when the force of that
Imagination is gone, which was the cause of their production : The
nature of a spirit, whither heavenly or heUish, being to dilate, or con-
tract themselves into as narrow compass, as they please ; so that in
a moment they can be as big in circumference as an hundred worlds,
and on a sodain reduce themselves to the compass of an atome.

5. Neither are they somuch limited as Tradition would have them ; Their Habita-
for they are not at all shut up in any separated place : but can remove ''°"'
millions of miles in the twinkling of an eye, yet are they still where

they were at first : for, out of their own element, or quality, they can
never come : go whither they will, they are in darkness : and the
cause is within them, not without them : as one whose mind is
troubled here in England, can remove his Carcase from the place 40.
where it was before ; but should he go to the utmost bounds of the
Earth, he cannot leave his perplexed and tormented minde behind
him.

6. As for the shapes and various likenesses of Devils, It is gener- Their shapes,
ally believed, that according to their various capacities in wickedness,

so their shapes are answerable after a Magical manner.- resembling
spiritually some horrid and ugly monsters, as their conspiracies
against the power of God, were high and monstrous, when they fell
from Heaven : for the condition of some of them is nothing but
continual horrour and despair ; others triumph in firie might and
pomp, attempting to pluck God from out of his Throne ; but the
quality of Heaven is shut from them, that they can never find it,
which doth greatly add to their torment and misery.

7. But that they are materially vexed and scorched in flames of xueir place of
fire, is inferiour to any to give credit to, who is throughly verst in p'easure or tor-
their nature and existence : for their substance is spiritual; yea their

power is greater, then to be detain'd or tormented with any thing
without them : doubtless their misery is sufficiently great, but not
through outward flames ; for their Bodies are able to pierce through
Wood and Iron, Stone, and all Terrestrial things : Neither is all the



494 ^°°'' "• -^ Discourse concerning

fire, or fewel of this World able to torment them ; for in a moment
they can pierce it through and through. But the infinite source of
their misery is i.i themselves, and is continually before them, so that
they can never enjoy any rest, being absent from the presence of
God .• which torment is greater to them, then all the tortures of this
world combin'd together.

appearmg agam, and answermg the Conjurations of Witches, and
Magicians, for a time : according to Nagar the Indian, and the
Pythagoreatis. And it cannot be easily conceived, that their torment
is much different from the rest of the Devils : for the Scripture saith:
every one is rewarded according to their works. And, that which a
mafi sows, that he shall reap. Now as the damned Spirits, when
they lived on earth, did heap up vanity, and load their souls with
iniquity, as a treasure to carry with them into that Kingdom, which
sin doth naturally lead into .• so when they are there, the same
abominations which here they committed, do they ruminate and feed
upon ; and the greater they have been, the greater is the torment,
that ariseth before them every moment.
How Magici- Q. And although these Infernal Spirits, are open Enemies to the

them ^^' ^^"^ '^'^I'y nieans which God hath appointed for mans salvation ; yet such
is the degenerate and corrupted mind of mankind, that there is in
the same an itching after them for converse and familiarity, to pro-
cure their assistance, in any thing that their vain imagination sug-
gesteth them with : to effect which, they inform themselves in every
Tradition of Conjuration and Exorcism ; as also in the names,
natures and powers of Devils in general, and are ever restless, till
their souls be totally devoted to that accursed and detestable nature,
which is at enmity with God and goodness.
The Orders of lo. Now to proceed in the description of these Infernal Spirits

in^gs.^" ^ ^ and separated Dcemons, or Astral Beings, as also of those in the

Angelical Kingdom ; they that pertain to the Kingdom of Heaven,
are either Angels which are divided into their degrees and orders ;
or else the righteous souls departed, who are entred into rest : And
it cannot be, but that the life of Angels and Souls departed, is the
same in Heaven, as also the food that nourisheth them, and the fruits
that spring before them .• Nor is it possible for any, how expert so
ever in Magical Arts, to compel either of them, of what degree so-
ever they be, to present themselves, or appear before them : Although
many have written large Discourses and Forms of Convocation, to
compel the Angels unto communication with them by Magical Rites
and Ceremonies.
Thaithcyaie ]i. It may indeed be believed, that seeing there are infinite num-



Devils and Spirits. chap. ii. 495

bei's of Angels, they are also imployed for the glory of God, and not subject to
protection of mankind, (but not subject to Conjurations :) And that ^"j^J"""^ '°"^"
they accompany many righteous men Invisibly, and protect Cities
and Countries from Plagues, War, and infestings of wicked Spirits,
against which Principalities and Powers of Darkness, it is their place
to contend and war, to the confusion of the Kingdom of Darkness.

12. But such Spirits as belong to this outward World, and are of What Spirits

degrees of continuance ; These may be solicited by Conjurations,

and can also inform Magicians in all the secrets of Nature ; yet so
darkly, (because they want the outward organ) ; that it is hardly
possible for any that hath fellowship with them, to learn any manual
operation perfectly and distinctly from them.

13. Many have insisted upon the Natures of these Astral Spirits : Thenatureof
some alledging. That they are part of the fain Angels, and conse- 1.;,^ ^"^^ '""
quently subject to the torments of Hell at the last Judgment : Others,

That they are the departed souls of men and women, confned to these
outward Elements until the Constmimation : Lastly, others. As Del
rio, Nagar the Indian Magician, and the Platonists affirm, That their
nature is middle between Heaven and Hell ; and that they reign in
a third Kingdom from both, having no other jiidgment or doom to
expect for ever.

also procreate one another; and have power sometimes to make great
commotions in the Air, and in the Clowds, and also to cloath them-
selves with visible bodies, out of the four Elements, appearing in
Companies upon Hills and Mountains, and do often deceive and
delude the observers of Apparitions, who take such for portents of
great alterations, which are nothing but the sports and pastime of

service : Others are subservient to the Angels that have dominion
over the Influences of the Stars : Others are the Astral Spirits of
men departed, which (if the party deceased was disturbed and
troubled at his decease,) do for many years, continue in the source of
this world ; amongst these airy Spirits, to the great disquietness of
the soul of the person, to whom they belong : Besides the causes are
various that such Spirits rest not ; i. When by Witchcraft they are
inchanted, and bound to wander so many years ; as thrice or fourtimes
seven, before they can be resolved into nothing. 2. When the person
hath been murthered ; so that the Spirit can never be at rest, till the
crime be discovered. 3. When desires and lusts, after Wife, or
Children, House, Lands, or Money, is very strong at their departure;
it is a certain truth, that this same spirit belonging to the Starrs will
be hanckering after these things, and drawn back by the strong
desires and fixation of the Imagination, which is left behind it : Nor
can it ever be at rest, till the thing be accomplished, for which it is
disturbed. 4. When Treasure hath been hid, or any secret thing
42. hath been committed by the party ; there is a magical cause of
something attracting the starry spirit back again, to the manifestation
of that thing. Upon all which, the following Chapters do insist more
largely and particularly.

changeth his: and if from good, the party degenerate to iniquity; then
by degrees the good Angel leaves him, and an evil Dcetnon doth
naturally succeed : for each thing draws after that which is like

to forbear the other : as in the Manuscript of Nagar the Indian, his
own testimony of himself is to tliis effect : My blessed Guardiufi
JBamtlfear, hatJi now so sweetly coniinunicated himself unto ine ; That
by all the manifestations, whereby a holy Daemon can attend and con-
verse with mankind, he appeareth unto me : first in the intellectual
way, he is ever present, and every moment prompts me, what to act,
what to forbear from actinj( : Ah had he not rushed u-p througJi the
powers of my soul, atid suddetily warned me in my Travel to Quiansi
in China, through the airy Region, to turn nimbly to the right hand,
at an instant, a mighty Troop of Devils, whose Leader was (Sracttiorlt,
coming tlirotigli that tract of air, had crusht me into a thotcsand
peices : This is the first degree of its appearing.

3. Then he proceedeth in the language of Sina, describing the
second way of its manifestation: And when the deepest sleep hath over-
-poured me, I atn 7iever without him ; sometimes my IBamilfear stands
before me like a glorious Virgin^ administring to me a Cup of the
drink of the Gods, which my Intellectual man exhausteth : sometimes
he brings ccslestial Compaiiies, and danceth round about me ; and
ulien after the weariness of the Settses, through contemplation I fell
into gentle sleep on the holy Mountain of Convocation, which is called
Adan, he shewed me the motion of the Heave?is, the nature of all things,
and the power of every evil Dccmon.

4. Thirdly, he continueth to describe the External appearance of The third way
the Genius, to this effect : Samilfeai" appears before me at my desire ; pearance.
for vty desires are as his desires : IVlien I slept a long space in my

private dwelling, he appeared outwardly, and watering me with the
dew 0 the fourth Heaven, I awakned, whoi he had tlirise jc?^ j^ailfein
i^agar ; so the time beitig come, we motcnted through the Air, unto the
holy Mountain of Convocation.

5. In this Example the three degrees of the Apparition of the Bonus Their number.
Genius, or Good DcB)no7i are excellently deciphered, which is also the

same in the appearance of the bad Genius: and according to the
deepest Magicians, there be seven good Angels, who do most frequently
become particular Guardians, of all others, each to their respective
capacities ; and also seven evil Dcemons, that are most frequent in
association with depraved persons, as Guardians to them.

y. These are the seven bad Angels or Dcenions.

As the power and capacity of the good, proceeds from the strength
of God, in the quality of heaven ; so is the force of the evil Genii, in
the hellish quality correspondent : for it is to be noted, that these
evil Angels did before their fall, enjoy the same places and degrees
that now the good or holy Angels do : so that as their power is to
instruct men in Government, Abstinence, Philosophy, Magick, and
Mechanick Arts, for a good intent, and for the glory of God : The
power of the evilont-s, is the very same to inform and instigate unto
the same attainments, as farr as they may be instrumental for the
Devil, or the Kingdom of Darkness therein.

8. Their names are i. Paiialrarp, like a Crocodile with two heads.

na^ like a Hunts-man. 4. (Srpifmotial accompanying his Pupil like a

till he hath brought his followers to destruction. 6. JHorborgran who
can put on various likenesses, especially appearing as a Serving-man.
7. ISarman who most commonly possesseth the soul of those that are
joyned unto him.

9. These are the names of the 7 good and evil DcE)iions ; according
to the antient writing, on the Magical Art : who do also to many
particular Cities and Countries, ascribe certain good and evil Angels ;
the one whereof protects and defends, the other inflicts Pestilence and
Famin upon them : Like unto which is the story recorded by Sigbertus
in Chronicis : That in the 1 1^^ year of the reign of Constans, a good
Attgel and a bad were seen by the whole City of Constantinople, nightly
to fly about the City ; and as often as by the conwiand of the good Aiigel,
the other smote any house with a dart in his hand, such was the ntimber
that dyed in that house, according to the stroaks given.

10. And indeed it is to be feared, that whosoever have ever
pretended, or do at present alledge, that they enjoy familiarity with a
familiar Spirit ; I say its greatly to be suspected, that all such
familiars belong to the Kingdom of Darkness ; for such are too too
officious, and ready to attend the depraved desires of mortal men^

whereas if communication with Angels, or good and holy Guardians
be at all attainable, yet such is the difficulty of the attainment, that
the examples thereof, if true, are exceeding rare : But in general, the
writings of Magicians and Naturallists do plentifully abound with
examples of this nature ; whether good or evil, is yet to be determined.
I have been told of a certain Country-man, in these dayes, who was
continually pestered with the company of a woman, discerned by
none but by himself: If he was upon Horse-back, she would be
behind him : if at dinner, she sate at his elbow ; if lying on his bed,
there she was also present ; And if at any time he had taken a
journey, or gone about some unprofitable business, at such a time she
accompanyed him not ; and seldom escaped he some mischief when
she was absent : But at last, for all her dutiful pretences, as she
accompanyed him, riding through a deep and swift running River, she
tumbled him into the deepest part, and lay upon him till she had
strangled or drowned him.

11. Amongst the y^wj- this kind of Idolatry was frequent, to consult
with and associate themselves unto familiar Spirits, whom they com-
pelled to do them domestick service, dressing their Camels, lifting
their burthens, and doing their messages : for the attaining their
service they had many blasphemous Forms, and superstitious Cere-
monies and Sacrifices ; making the holy Names of God subservient
to their accursed practices : one whose name was 1jaal=]jpn=ainmtll,
was adjudged by the Law of Moses to be burnt for the like practices ;
being condemned in the time of one Jtidah a high Priest in the
Captivity for killing an Infant, and with its blood performing Sacrifice
to Ijaalff Jiut, with various ceremonies intermixed ; by which means
his God had bequeathed unto him a certain Lacky from the Infernal
Troop to attend and serve him for his whole life time : this is to be
found in Zom^s Coment upon Berosus, and Belus, who affirms, That
at his tryal he eiideavonred to prove, that the same was the good
Angel or Genius given unto him by the juercy of God.

12. Both the Hebrew Cabalists and Heathen Magiciafis, as also
those addicted to Magick in Christianity, have all of them laid down
certain forms of attaining the company of a good, or evil Angel, by
number and astrological Observations, fitted to the rules of Conjura-
tion and Invocations : And many of the superstitious Rabbi's have
affirmed. That they were able by such practices, to cause tJie ghost of
Adam, Eve, or any of the holy Patriarchs to appear unto them : which
was surely the delusion of Satan to harden their hearts. But in the

Of the Astral Spirits of men departed : What they are : And why
they appear again: And what Witchcraft may be wrought
by them.



'■A



S the Astral Spirits separate, which belong not to any
deceased person, do for many years survive, or continue ;
so if the party deceased hath departed in discontent, and
melancholy, it is often known that they return again, and causing
terrour to families and houses, do wait for opportunity to dis-
burthen themselves, that at length they may come into their
desired rest.

2. The opinion of many is, That the Devill in their likenesse is all
that appears : But the more Learned have sufficiently demonstrated,
through Example, and Experience ; TJiat the apparition is really
proper to the person deceased. Nor can it easily be denyd, That to
every man, and woman, while they live the natural Life, there belongs
a Syderial, or starry Spirit ; which takes its original wholly from the
Elemental property : And according to the weaker, or stronger
capacity of the party, it hath the longer, or shorter continuance, after
the bodyes decease.

3. Such persons as are secretly murthered, and such as secretly
murthur themselves, do most frequently appear again, and wander
near the place where their Carcase is, till the radical moisture be totally
consumed : according to the opinion of Paracelsus, after the con-
sumption whereof, they can re-appear no longer, but are resolv'd into
their first being, or Astru?n, after a certain term of months, or years,
according to the vigour, or force of that first attraction which was the
only cause of their returning.

4. The manner and seasons of their appearing are various : Some-
times before the person, unto whom they do belong, depart this life,
they do by external presentations forewarn him, near the time, that
the day of death approacheth. As it is reported of Codrus Lacenus^ to
whom an empty, meager Ghost appeared at midnight, signifying unto
him, how sad and lachrymable a Tragedy was shortly to attend him ;
and also adding, that he would visit him in the Executioft thereof:
which proved not contrary to the words of the apparition ; for at the
very instant, when his Treacherous Wife had stab'd him at the heart,
on a suddain he beheld the same, with preparations for his interment,
whilst he yet survived, after the fatall wound was given.

5. Sometimes the starry spirit of a person appears to his beloved
Companion, many hundred of miles asunder, who was ignorant of
the death of the party : And it hath often been heard, that when none
of the kindred or family of the said party deceased, have ever been
disturbed by it, or in the least been sensible of its appearing ; yet to
some of its most intimate acquaintance, it discovers it self, and
importunes them to perform some ceremony, or other, that it may be
returned into rest ; or else discovers some treasure, which was hid by
the party whilest alive, or else some murther which it had commited :
But the most frequent cause of their returning, is when the party hath
himself been privately murthered.

6. For such is the poysonous malice, and bloudy spirit of the
murtherers, that it sufficeth them not to have privately bereaved them
of their Lives ; but also by certain earnest Wishes, Curses, and Con-
jurations, they do afterwards adjure them, that for such a term of
years, they shall never have power to appear again : Which wishes,
being earnestly given forth, from the hellish root in the murtherer, do
exceedingly torment the murthered parties spirit, taking deep im-
pression thereon ; so that it is alwayes in continual sorrow, and
anguish, till the term of years be expired, and till the murther be
made manifest to the world : after which discovery, it returns to
perfect rest ; This is well known to those that are exercised in
Witchcraft, and cruell Murthers, though not common to those that
murther but once.

7. There be many Ancient families, in Europe, to whom the Ghost
of their first Progenitor, or Ancestor appears immediately before the
departure of some Heir, or chief in the same family : which assertion
is confirmed by Cardan, in an Example of "an Antient family, in the
" Dukedome of Parma, called the Tortells, to whom there belongs an
"ancient Castle, with a spatious Hall ; near the Chimney of the said
" Hall an old decrepit Woman, for these hundreds of years, is wonted
" to appear, when any of the Family is about to dye : And it is
" reported amongst them that the same is the Ghost of one belonging
" to the same name, and family, who for her Riches, was murthered by
"some of her Nephews, and thrown into a pit.

8. Many such apparitions do for many years continue to be seen in
one particular place; ever watching for opportunity, to discover some
murther, or Treasure hid : And the cause of the difficulty of the said
discovery, consists in the nature of their substance ; for could they
make use of the organ of the Tongue, they might quickly discover
it : or if they had the outward benefit of Hands, they might pro-
duce the said Treasure, or Carcase murthered, but this they are
seldome able to accomplish ; being destitute of the outward Organs,



Devils and Spirits. chap. hi. 503

and mediation of Hands to hold withall, or Tongue to vent their
grievances : And that this is true, the manner of their appearance
dotli confirm it : For all that they are able to effect, If they have
been murthered, is commonly to appear near the very place, where
their body lies, and to seem as if they sunk down, or vanished in the
same ; or else to appear in the posture of a murthered person, with
mangled, and bloudy wounds, and hair disshevel'd : But it is rarely
known, that any such apparitions have plainly spoken, or uttered by
words, the time of their murther, with the cause, the persons name,
or place ; unless the murther, by circumstances hath been more then
ordinary, horrid, and execrable : then the remembrance of the same
doth sometimes enable the apparition to frame a voice, by the
assistance of the Air, and discover the fact.

9. But to speake in general concerning apparitions, why they are so j^''"'^ pariicu-
seldome seen ; and why such spirits as appear, can not without mans same.
assistance accomplish their design ; It may easily be apprehended,

that all Spirits, or spiritual Substances, and Devills, have their life,
breath, and motion in another source, or Element then this external
world ; And as any creature, whom the Element of Water hath
nourished, and bred, can live but short while upon the Land ; So its
with them, when they come out of their proper habitations : which is
the cause of the rarity of apparition ; it being as difficult for any
spirit to manifest it self in this outward principle, of the four
Elements, as for a man to continue with his head under water : yea
it is rather pain, then pleasure for any spirit, whether good, or bad, to
come into this outward world.

10. Great is the villany of Necromancers, and wicked Magicians, The nefarious

.,, . . r 1 1 1 , • practices of

m dealmg with the spirits of men departed ; whom they invocate, Necromancers
with certain forms, and conjurations, digging up their Carkasses '" *" examp e.
again, or by the help of Sacrifices, and Oblations to the infernal Gods;
compelling the Ghost to present it self before them : how this was
performed in antient times, by Hags, and Witches, is notably
described in the AZtJiiopian History of Heliodorus, in the practice
" of an antient woman, who coming into the Camp, in the dead of
"night; where amongst many slaughtered bodies, the body of her
" Son was also slain ; whose carkase she laid before her, digging a
" hole, and making a fire on each side, with the body in the midst ;
" Then taking an earthen pot from a three footed stool, she poured
" honey out of it, into the pit ; then out of another pot, she poured
" milk ; and likewise out of the third : Lastly, she cast a Lump of
''hardned dough, in the form of a man into the pit : the Image was
" Crowned with Lawrell : then she threw in some of the Shrub called
" Bdellium : This done, with a sword she ran frantickly up and down.

" cutting herself ; and with a Lavvrell branch sprinkled of her blood
" into the fire : at length whispering at her Sons ear, she caused him
" to arise, and questioning him of the fortune of his Brother, what was
" become of him, he answered dubiously speaking prosperity to two
" persons that secretly beheld her, and telling her, That suddain death
" for her impiety attended her, which came to passe ere she left the
" place ; after all these predictions, the Carcase ceased to answer any
" more : and tumbled groveling on the ground again.

11. And although by most men, as also by the Author in his fore-
going Discovery, it is constantly believed, that the Witch of Endor
raised not Samuel, nor the Ghost of Samuel, as not beleeving that
there is an Astral Spirit or Ghost belonging unto every Man ; yet it
is very probable, that by her conjurations she caused his Sydereal
Spirit to appear : which is possible to be effected : and hath been
often done : as Weaver in his Funeral Monuments records of
Edward Kelly, " who in the Park of Walton Ledale in the County
"Lancaster, with one Paul IVaring; Invocated a Uevil, and after-
" wards digg'd up the Corps of a poor man, that had been buried that
" very day, in a place near the same, called Law Church-yard : whom
" he compelled by Incantations, and Conjurations to speak, and
" utter prophetical words, concerning the master of one of his
" Assistants.

12. According to the state and condition wherein a person dyes,
so is it with their Astral Spirit: for if they died in perfect peace, and
had come through the valley of true Repentance ; being dead to this
Life before it left them ; then their starry Spirit doth enter into
rest, in its proper source, or quality at the instant of their Decease:
nor is it possible for all the Conjurations in Hell, to cause them to
return, or appear again.

13. But some might object, That Samuel was an Holy Prophet,
and attaind unto a perfect Life ; which is thus to be answered, that
before Christ came into the world, none of the most Holy Prophets
of God, did ever attain to that degree of blessednesse, that the Chris-
tians after Christ possessed: for in the time of the Law, a covering, or
vail was spread over the faces of all people : and something there
was that letted, or hindred their souls from any plain and perfect
vision, and fruition of God ; otherwise then through types, and
shaddows, which partition wall, the end of Christs Incarnation was to
break down.

14. In the writings of Plato, there be many strange Relations of
the apparitions of Souls, of their torments, and purgations, of the
cause of their returning, what their nature is, what their substance
and property is, and what their food, and nourishment is : but he



Devils and SphHts. chap. m. 505

mistakes the Soicl for the Astral Spirit : for the Soul in its returning
and apparition is farr different ; if a Holy Soul appear, it is to
persons like it self, and that in sleep, warning them of dangers, and
discovering heavenly secrets unto them : And if a Damned Soul
appear, it is likewise to such as are of a nature like it self: whom
it instigates, asleep, teaching them notorious Villanies in Dreams ;
and provoking them to every wicked cogitation,

15. The sect oi Pythagoras have strange and antick opinions, con- Oi Pythagoras.
cerning Souls, and Ghosts, or starry Spirits : whom they alledge

to be frequently converted into Gods^ or DcBinons, or Demi-Gods, and
Heroes : (as the Platonicks do,) And that there is a continual tra-
duction, and transmigration of Souls, from one to another, till they
attain to be deify'd at last ; and then that they do frequently appear,
to those that be like themselves ; instructing, and forewarning
them : It was also the belief of many wise, and antient Philosophers,
that the Oracles were from such Dccinons, as had been the Ghosts, or
Souls of wise and excellent men : as Apollo^s 07'acle, and the
Oracle of Pallas, or Minerva : which opinions have much of reason
and probability.

16. It is also the opinion of some, that the particular Spirits of Of o;her Phi-
famous men do after the death of the body, take up some particular °^°^ ^'^^'
habitations, near such places Cities, Towns, or Countries, as they

most do affect, as Tutelaries, and Guardians unto them ; Which is
reported by Vopiscus, of Apollonitts Thyaneus ; That when his City
Thyana was taken by Aureliajitts the Emperour : and when he was
in his Tent, pondering furiously how to destroy the same ; the
Ghost of Apollonius appeared unto him saying, Aurelianus, if thou
desirest to be a Coiiqiierour, suppose not to slay these my Citizens :
Aurelianus, if thou wilt be a Ruler, shed no innocent blood : Aurelianus,
be meek, and gentle, if thou wouldst be a Conquerour.l

17. I have heard many wonderful Relations from Lunaticks or such 48,

as are almost natural fools, who have asserted, That being for many The Raptures
dales together conversant amongst Faeries in Woods, Mountains, and
Caverns of the Earth, they have feasted with them, and been magni-
ficently Entertaind with variety of dainties, where they have seen
several of their Neighbours or Familiar acquaintance in the habit they
were wont to weare, notwithstanding they were known to have been
dead some years before.

1 8. And many Learned Authors have also insisted upon this par- Their Enter-
ticular, alledging, That when such as the Faery es have brought into
their Society do feast and junket with them, though they have a real
and perfect knowledge of their neighbours and acquaintance amongst
the rest, yet their Language they are not able to understand, neither

do these Acquaintance of theirs acknowledge or take notice of them at
all, bnt do either sit {both they and all the rest) in a profound attd
tedious silence, or else discottrse in a tnost stiipcndious kinde of Gibber-
ish, not intelligible to strnttgers.

19. But more particularly to illustrate this conjecture, I could name
the person who hath lately appeared thrice since his Decease, at
least some Ghostly being or other, that calls it self by the name
of such a person who was dead above an hundred years agoe, and
in his life time accounted as a Prophet or Praedicter by the
assistance of Sublunary Spirits. And now at his appearance did also
give out strange Praedictions concerning Famine, and Plenty, Warrs,
and Bloodshed, and the end of this world.

20. By the affirmation of the person that had Communication
with him, the last of his Appearances was on this following manner ;
 had been, said he, to sell a Horse at the next Market Town, but not
attaining my price, as I returned home by the way I tnet this man afore-
said who began to be familiar with me, asking what ne^us, and how
affairs moTed throughout the Country ; I answered as I thought fit ;
withall I told him of my Horse whom he began to cheapen, and pro-
ceeded with me so far, that the price was agreed upon ; so he turned
back with me and told me, that if I would go along with him, I should
receive my Money ; on our way we went, I upon my Horse and he on
another milk white beast ; after much discourse I askt him where he
dwelt, and what his name was ; he told me, That his dwelling was
about a 7nile off, at a place called Farran ; of which place I had never
heard though I knew all the Country round about ; he also told
me, That he himself was that person of the Family of Learmonts so
much spoken off for a Prophet ; At which I began to be somewhat
fearful, perceiving us in a road which I had never been in before,
which increased my fear and admiration more. Well on we went till
he brought me under ground I know not how into the presence of a
beautiful woman that payd me the moneys without a word speaking ;
he conducted me out again through a large and long entry, where I
saw above 600 men in Armour layd prostrate on the ground as if
asleep : at last I found my self in the open field by the help of
Moon-light in that very place where first I met him, and made shift
to get home by three in the morning, but the money I received was
just double of what I esteemed it, and what the woman payd me, of
which at this instant I have several pieces to show consisting of nine
pences, thirteen pence halfpennies, &^c.

21. The variety of Examples throughout the writings of Learned
men may serve as stronge inducements to confirm this particular of
Astral Spirits, or Ghosts that belong unto Mortal men, returning

after death untill the cause of their returning be taken
away. In Ancient times before the name of Christianity, there
was nothing more frequent than milHons of Apparitions in fields
where battails had been fought, seeming to fight as they had
done at first, which the Ancient Heathens believed to proceed from
the want of Burying. And from this arose the Poetical Romance of
the luandring of Ghosts besides the River Styx for an hundred years.
And the custome of Solemn Interment amongst them.

22. But with more probability. The Custome of the Funeral Piles 'Why Funeral
used by the Ronans, and the Urns to reduce their Corpses into Ashes, stituted.
was instituted at first to prevent the torment of the Deceased, least

his Ghost should wander, or return, which doubtlesse from a natural
cause may have the same effect, that the reducing of the carcase into 49^
Ashes suddainly after its decease may prevent the return of the
Astral Spirit ; for if it be true what is affirmed by Paracelstis, that
the starry Spirit can continue no lons^er theti the radical moisture in
the body ; it will naturally follow that its appearance is at an end
when the body is burnt, seeing that the moisture is totally extermi-
nate and consumed thereby. And in some sense the Ceremony may
be said to be Laudable and Judicious, having so beneficial a conse-
cjuence.

23. As there is some semblance of a natural cause in the custome What the want
of the Antient urns, so likewise may the Interment of slaughtered seth.""^ "^^^
bodies by the like cause prevent the like Appearances ; for many

are the examples that I have read of such as appeared to their
surviving kindred and acquaintance, after they had been slaughtered
in the Warrs, beseeching them to perform unto their bodies the
Sacred Funeral Rites that their Ghosts might return into Rest, for
which many have consulted with the Oracles to be informed whether
the deceased deserved Burial, because they held it unlawful to bury
Murtherers, Incestuous and Sacriligious, persons, which Nature her
self doth also seem to hold if this following Relation be not false :
which was, " That some Learned men returning from Persia where
" they had been to see the King Cosroes, by the way interr'd a dead
" Carcase which they found unburied : And in the following night the
" Ghost of an Ancient Matron, as if it had been the Spirit of the
" World or Madam Nature her self, appeard unto them, saying. Why
" Intcrr ye that nefarious Carcase ? let the Doj::;gs devoure it ; Tlie
" Earth who is the Mother of us all admitts not of that man that
" depj-aves his Mother: So returning they found the Carcase yet
" unburied.

24. To confirm the verity of Astral Spirits proper, and their „, , .

" In the mean time going to Bury him they found him yet alive, but

" Seven years after that he was seen at Proconncstis his native Town,

Apollonius, and Pythagoras, whom their followers would have to be
Ubiquitajyes, affirming, That at one instant of time they were seen in
[■^ sic] several places tliousands of miles in distance. And though in '^'lam-

blichns who hath wrote the Life of Pythagoras, in Philostratus that
wrote the Life of Apollonius Tyatites, there be many fabulous things
reported as to the Astral Spirits separation, and return unto the
body ; Yet I have sufficiently here endeavoured to separate the true
from the more Poetical part in this particular Subject of the starry
Spirits belonging to every individual man and woman, and their
returning after the body falls away.

commonf "" X J. nature of the Astral Spirits proper, that belong to every

individual ; The subject of this present Chapter shall be of

Astral Spirits separate ; which are not constitute to any peculiar

work or service, but do only, according to their nature and temper,

{■\ sicZ haunt such places in the sublunary world as are most correspendentf

to their natures, and existence.

And they are said to be substitute under the seven Caslestial Angels
that govern the influences of the superiour Spheres, being equal in



Devils and Spirits. chap. iv. 509

their name and continuance with that planet whose Spirit they are,
that is, till the Consummation of all things visible.

3. And in that houre, month, day or year, wherein their Planet The Power of
hath the most dominion, then is their efficacy most prevalent, and ''^'^ Planets.
their operation the most powerful upon inferiour bodies, whether to

the destruction or prosperity of that animal vegitative or mineral
subject to their Influences, according to the dignification of the
Planet at that instant Dominion ; for if ill affected, their nature is to
blast with Mildew, Lightning, and Thunder any Vegetative proper
to their Planet ; To deprive any Animal of sight or the motion of
the nerves under their Dominion ; And lastly, bring Plagues, Pesti-
lence, and Famine, Storms, and Tempests, or on the Contrary to bring
sweet and excellent Influences upon Animals, or Vegetatives under
their Planetary Regiment, if well and honourably dignified.

4. Innumerable are the Spirits that inhabit the Aiery Region, Spirits of the
germinating amongst themselvs as Magicians affirm, and begetting

one another after a Mystical manner. It is their property to be instant
in storms and boistrous weather, which is said to be joy and delight
unto them ; And in such a season they may with most facility be
calld upon, and make their appearance, which they do accordingly
to their age, and youthfulness, seeming young or old at their appear-
ance answerable to their years. Besides they march in mighty
Troops through the Aiery Region, waging warr amongst themselves,
and destroying one anothers beings or Existences, after which they
are reduced to the primary source or nature of the Starrs. This is
likewise to be observed that according to the Language, Vigour, Life,
and Habit of that Region wherein they live, such is their Habit,
Language, and Ability, one Caterva or Company being ignorant of
their Neighbours, or Enemies Language, so that they have need of the
Assistance of such Spirits as dwell in onmibus Elementis, to be their
Interpreters.

5. And doubtless from hence arise the various deceptions that* Their Actions.
men are incident unto in their judgments of Apparitions, perswading [* thutf.iv]
themselves that they are portents and foretokens of Warr and Famine,

when such numerous Spirits are beheld Fighting or Marching either
in the Air, Earth, or Water : whereas it is nothing else but the bare
effect of the Natures and Tempers of such Aerial beings to fight and
randevouse immediately after sun-set, or else later in the Summer
evenings, which is their principal time of such Conventions. And
though it must be confest that such Spirits may be, and are the
Devils Instruments as appertaining to the Kingdom whereof he is
Ruler ; Yet considered in themselves, their Nature is wholly harmless,
as to ought that may be called innate Evill, having nothing in them

that is eternal as the Soul of Man : and consequently nothing in them
that is able to make them capable of enjoying Heaven, or induring
the torments of Hell.

6. And it is believed by some, that according to the motion of the
spheres, there are certain companies of Aerial Spirits good and bad
that follow them in their motions round the earth, the good distilling
influences that are good, and the bad, such influences as are destruc-
tive to every thing that is under their Dominion. It is also believed
that by the assistance of Devils, and damned Spirits, such Aerial
Spirits are given for Familiars to some Magicians add* Witches with
whom they are said to have actual copulation, and the enjoyment of
every dainty meat through their assistance, being able thereby to go
invisible, to fly through the air, and steal Treasures and Jewels from
the Cofl'ers of Princes, as also carouse in Wine-sellers, and Pantries
of those that are most amply provided with the choisest Daynties.

7. Subordinate unto these of the Air are the Terrestrial Spirits,
which are of several degrees according to the places which they
occupy, as Woods, Mountains, Caves, P^ens, Mines, Ruins, Desolate
places, and Antient Buildings, calld by the Antient Heathens after

[" read, Lamia:^ various names, as Nymphs, Satyrs, Lamii^* Dryades, Sylvanes, Cobalt,
&^c. And more particularly the Faeries, who do principally inhabit
the Mountains, and Caverns of the Earth, whose nature is to make
strange Apparitions on the Earth in Meddows, or on Mountains being
like Men, and Women, Souldiers, Kings, and Ladyes Children, and
Horse-men cloathed in green, to which purpose they do in the night
steal hempen stalks from the fields where they grow, to Convert them
into Horses as the Story goes. Besides, it is credibly affirmed and
beleev'd by many, That such as are real Changlings, or Lunaticks,
have been brought by such Spirits and Hobgoblins, the true Child
being taken away by them in the place whereof such are left, being
commonly half out of their wits, and given to many Antick practices,
and extravagant fancies, which passions do indeed proceed from the
powerful influence of the Planet in their nativity, and not from such
foolish conjectures.

Facrie-s. 8. Sucli jocund and facetious Spirits are sayd to sport themselvs in

the night by tumbling and fooling with Servants and Shepherds in
Country houses, pinching them black and blew, and leaving Bread,
Butter, and Cheese sometimes with them, which if they refuse to eat,
some mischief shall undoubtedly befall them by the means of these
Faeries. And many such have been taken away by the sayd Spirits,
for a fortnight, or a month together, being carryed with them in
Chariots through the Air, over Hills, and Dales, Rocks and Precipices,
till at last they have been found lying in some Meddow or Mountain

bereaved of their sences, and commonly of one of their Members to
boot.

9. Certainly the Lares and Penates, or houshold Gods of the antient Lare?, and Do-
Heathens were no other than such like Spirits who for several years "u"'"^ '^'
would keep their residence in one house till upon some displeasure

offered, or offences done by any of the sayd Family, they departed
and were never afterwards heard of. There are plenty of such
examples to be found in Olaus Magmcs, and Hector Boethus* in his [* r,-ad. Boe-
History of 6't'£'a«^, relating? wonderful passages of ^odin-gofldetows, ' '"^
and such as have been familiar amongst mankind.

10. Jiurtian a familiar of this kinde did for many years inhabit the Lun'Jan a. (sl-

place of Man-servant and Maid-servant with wonderful diligence to

these Families whom he did haunt, sweeping their rooms, and washing
their dishes and making their fires before any were up in the morning.
This iLuriliail affirmed, That he was the _^em'us Astral, of that Island
that his place or residence in the dayes of Solomon and David was at
Jerusaiem ; That then he was called by the Jewes Brlflai^, and after
that he remaind Long in the Dominion of Wales, instructing their

lialfeill, whom he called the Lord of the Northerti Mountains, affirming '^'^"

that he was shaped like a Satyr and fed upon the Air, having Wife

the Northern Faeries inhabiting Soiitherland and Catenes with the
adjacent Islands ; And that these were the Companies of Spirits that
hold continual wars with the Fiery Spirits in the Mountain Heckla
that vomits fire in Islandta. That their speech was antient Irish,
and their dwelling the Caverns of the Rocks, and Mountains, which

Aniiqiiorum, Concerning a young man from whom the power of ^'"^ ^'
Vemes was taken away so that he could not Company with his new
marryed Wife. The Story is briefly thus ; " Being busy at play or

" exercise with some of his Companions on his marriage day, he put
" his wedding Ring on the finger of the Statue of Venus that stood
" besides the place least it should be lost ; when he had done, returning
" to take his Ring, the finger was bended inward, so that he could by
" no means pluck off the Ring to his great amazement, at which 52,
" instant he forsooke the place, and in the night the Image of Venus

" appeared unto him, saying, Thou hast espoused me, and shalt not
" meddle with any other : in the morning returning, the Ring was gone,
" and the finger made straight again, which troubled him mightily, so
" that he consulted with a Magician, who wrote a Letter to some
" Principal Spirit in that Dominion to which Venis belong'd, bidding
" the party stand watching at such a place at such an houre till he saw
" many troops of Spirits pass by him, and describmg one in a Chariot,
" of stern and terrible Countenance, to whom he bad him deliver the
" Letter ; All which he performed, and after the person in the Chariot
"had read the contents thereof, he broke out into this expression,
"great God, how long shall we be subject to the insolencies of this
"accursed Rascal, naming the Magitian : But withal calling to a most
" beauteous Woman from amongst the Company, he charged her to
" deliver back the Ring which at length she did with much aversness,
"and after that he injoyd his Marriage rites without impediment.

13. Besides the innumerable Troops of Terrestrial Spirits called
Faeryes there are also Nymphs of the Woods, Mountains, Groves, and
Fountains, as (Paglf.* !arPtf)U0a. lo, iBfntppa, Irnif, &c. who are sayd
to be altogether of the faeminine kinde, sporting and dancing, and
feasting amongst the trees in Woods, and bathing in clean and limpid
Fountains ; such have been seen by many, and are often alluded to,
by the Roman and Greek Poets. There is also a relation of a Gennan
Prince, " who being exceeding thirsty and weary with hunting and
" hawking, lost his Company in the Woods, on a suddain beheld an
" opening at a little hillock amongst the trees, and a most beautiful
" Maiden offering a Golden Horn full of Liquor, which he received and
" drunk, and after rid quite away with the sayd Horn, not regarding the
" Virgins tears, who lamented after him ; tis sayd that having spilt
" some of the sayd Liquor, it fetcht the hair from off his Horses skin,
" and the horn is yet to be seen in Germatiy^ which I have been told by
" one that hath seen and handled it, affirming, That the Gold for purity

that the Hunns have the original, being begotten betwixt these Inrtltt,
and certain Magical women whom Philimer the King of the Goths
banished into the deserts, whence arose that savage and untamed
Nation, whose speech seemed rather the mute attempts of brute
Beasts, than any articulate sound and well distinguished words. To
these Incubi are attributed the diseases of the blood called \\\q. Night-
hag, which certainly have a natural cause, although at the instant of
time when the party is oppressed, it is probable that certain malevolent
Spirits may mix themselvs therein and terrifie the soul and minde of

15. And amongst such Spirits as are resident amongst mortals, a froward
there is a very froward kinde, who take delight to pull down what

man hath builded, who have been seen at the building of strong and
mighty Castles to come in the night and tumble all to the ground
that the workmen had reared the day before ; of this sort were iijoron,
S'tilfeon, <®Iaura, and IXtttoIIa, four pestiferous, and turbulent Animals
that for many years infested the first founders of the Emperours
Seraglio : Till one of the holy Musselmans did by certain Charms,
and Exorcisms constrain and bind them, to tell their names, and the
cause of their disturbing, which they declared, and were by him con-
fined to destroy the mines of Copper in Hungaria.

16. There is also a Relation extant in the life oi Paul the Hermit Example.
of a Satyr appearing to him in the Woods, and discoursing with him

that it was a mortal Creature as he, and served the same God,
dehorting the people to worship them for demi-Gods, as they had
been accustomed to ; Like unto this is the Story of the Death of the
great God Pan ; That a Mariner sailing by the Island of Cicilia,
was called by his name from the shore, and by a certain voice was Example.
bid to tell the Inhabitants of the next Island, that the great God Pan
was dead, which he obeyed, and though in the next Island there were 53.
no Inhabitants, yet when he approached he proclaimed, towards the
shoar that Pan was deceased, immediately after which Proclamation
he could sensibly hear most doleful and lachrymable Cryes, and
noyses, as of those that lamented his departure.

17. Eanti&P. is sayd by Magitians, to be a water Spirit, who is ever janthez.%f\x
present when any are drownd in the water, being delighted much in °^ *® ^^'®'^*
the destruction of mankinde, that it may enjoy the Company of their

Astral Spirits after their decease ; for according to the four Com-
plexions or Constitutions of the body of Man, The Astral Spirit
associates it self with separated substances ; The Phlegmatick,
to the watry Spirits : The Sanguine, to those of the Aire ; The
Cholerick, to the Fire ; and the Melancholy, to the Terrestrial
Spirits. But this is only to be supposed of such persons as dyed
in discontent, and restlesness.

18. Of another sort are such Aquatick Aiiitnals as in former times Watry Spirits
have conversed, and procreated with mankinde bearing divers Children ; ' '*' procreate.
And at length snatching all away into the watry Element again,

whereof there are variety of Examples in Cardanus and Bodin. Of
this sort was the Familiar of Paiilus a Mendicant Frier, called by him
;iFIorintcIIa, and entertaind as his Bed-fellow for forty years, though
unknown and unseen to any but himself, till upon some unhandsome
carriage of the Fryer, his Companion accompanymg him over the
Damibe^ leapt into the River and was never after seen.

19. Innumerable are the reports and accidents incident unto such
as frequent the seas, as fisher-men and sailers who discourse of noises,
flashes, shadows, ecchoes, and other visible appearances nightly seen,
and heard, upon the surface of the water. And as the disposition of the
Heavens is according to the constellations, and climates, so are these
spectres appropriate to particular parts, and coasts, from the North to
the Southern Pole. But more especially, abounding in the North,
about Nof'weigh Isleland, Green Land, and Nova Zenibla.

20. Neither are the Storyes of the Greek, and Latine Poets all
together to be sleighted in this particular ; for many verities are inter-
-woven with their fictions, they speak of vocal Forrests, as Dodona, of
Talkative Rivers, as Scaniander, of sensitive Fountains as Arethusa,
Menippa, and ALagle ; Which more credible Historians have partly
confirmed in the Relation of Dodona, asserting that the trees do seem
to speak by reason of the various Apparitions, and Phantasms, that
attend the Forrest. And also in the Story of the River Scamander,
which is sayd at this day to afford plenty of spectres, and prophetical
Spirits, that have nightly conversation with the Tttrkish Sailers
coming by that way with Gallyes into the Mediterranean.

21. The like is reported of a Castle in Norweigh standing over a
Lake wherein a Satyr appeareth sounding a Trumpet before the death
of any Souldier, or Governour belonging to the same, tis sayd to be
the Ghost of some murdered Captain that hath become so Fatal, and
Ominous to his Successors. But with more probability may be
called a Spectre proper to the place according to the Constellation.

22. And it hath been the conjecture of eminent speculators that
from the Loins of such arise the numerous brood of Elves, Faeryes,
Lycajithropi ; And P]i,'';;y'i?^, sometimes visible, .sometimes invisible in
Green-Land ?ind. the adjacent rocks where they have no concomitants,
but bears and scurvy-grass to mix, and make merry withal, except
they pass from thence to the Northern parts of America, where they
shall find their ofif-spring adored for Gods, and Goddesses, by the
ignorant Inhabitants about new Albion, and as far South as Mexico,
as is amply related in the discourses of Drake, Cortes and PiircJias
concerning the conquest and discovery of these Territoryes.

23. By Apparitions upon the water many have been tempted to leap
into the Sea in pursuit thereof till they were drowned, of which
spectres there is a sort called by Pselhis, Ordales, who do appear like
Ducks or other Water fouls, till they by fluttering upon the water, do
entice their followers to pursue them so farr that many perish in the
attempt, which doth greatly delight these faithless Spirits who (as we
have said before) do long to accompany their Astral Spirits after their
decease. An Example of this kinde I my self knew, besides the



Devils and Spirits. cnu-. iv. 5 1 5

numerous relations I have had from the mouths of others, which con-
firm the opinions of the antient Magicians concerning these water
Spirits, that of all the rest they are the most deceitful, and dangerous,
like the flattering Seas, and swift gliding Torrents, that when they
have wonn any thing, to admire, and sound them, do carry them
violently into the abysse of their own Element.

24. But we will leave the waters and insist a little on the nature of
Igneous or Fiery Spirits that inhabit the Mountains in Hecla, ^Etna, Fiery Spirits.
Propo Champ, and Poconzi ; Where the Courts, and Castles of these
puissant Champions are kept. The opinion of some is, That they are What these
not Astral, but Infernal Spirits, and Damned Souls, that for a term ^"^ ^ ^^^'
of years are confined to these burning Mountains for their Iniquities :

Which opinion although it be granted, yet we may assert. That for
the most part the apparitions, sounds, noices, clangors, and clamors,
that are heard about the Mountain Hccla in Island ^.nd other places,
are the effects of separated Starry beings, who are neither capable of
good nor evill, but are of a middle vegetative nature, and at the
dissolution of the Media Natura shall be again reduced into their
primary JEih&v.

25. And from natural Causes, it may be easily demonstrated, That why they de-
there is great Correspondence betwi.xt such substances, and the Ele- J-'feiVmenf '"^
ment of fire, by reason of the Internal Flagrat and Central Life
proceeding from the Quintessence or* one only Element which upholds [* > of]
them, in Motion, Life, and Nourishment. As every natural, and
supernatural being is upheld, and maintain'd out of the self-same

root from whence it had its original, or rise ; So the Angels feed upon
the Celestial Manna, The Devils of the fruits of Hell, which is
natural to their appetite, as trash for swine ; the Astral beings ; of the
source of the stars, the Beasts, Birds, or Reptiles of the fruits of
the Eatth,t and the gas of the Air, the fishes of the blass of the [1 sic]
Water ; But more particularly, every thing is nourished by its
Mother, as Infants at the Breast, either by e.xhausting or fomen-
tation.

26. Such Spirits are very officious in the burnings of Towns, or Spiritsth.it
Cole-pits, delighting much to dance and e.xult amidst the flames, and
become Incendiaries worse then the material Cause of the Combus-
tion, often tempting men in drukeness,J to burn their own Houses, [j sic]
and causing Servants carelesly to sleep, that such unlucky accidents

may happen. As the Story of Kzarwilwui a Town in Poland doth
confirm, which was reduced to ashes by three of these pestilentious
Animals, called ^aggos. Uroitnlral, and UallrtDin, who after many open
Threatnings for si.x months together, that they would destroy the City,
and Citizens, did on a dark and stormy night, set all on fire on a

for the most part in tumbling, and fooling one with another when the
flames are most impetuous, and violent in the Mountains.- And it is
likewise credited by some that their office is to cruciate and punish
some Evil Livers, retaining, and tormenting their Souls, or Astral
Spirits for many years after the Bodies decease, which is too empty a
notion to be hearkened unto by any that are well informed of their
natures.
Why they de- 28. Neither is it to be wondered at that they are so much delighted

fien'^ quality. ^'''■^ ^^ fiery quality in regard of their affinity and appropriation with
infernal spirits, whose state and being is altogether damnable and
deplorable ; for although they have not the ability of attaining either
the Heavenly or Infernal quality, by reason that they are utterly voyd
of the innermost Center, and may be rather called bruits, then rational
* Fire] Animals, yet because they belong to the outermost *principle, such is

their innate Affinity, and Unity with the dark World, or infernal King-
dome that they do often become the Devils Agents to propagate his
works upon the face of the Earth.
Astral Spirits 55. 29. By the Instigations of infernal Spirits they are often sent to
the"dev[ri.''' terrifie men with nocturnal visions, in the hkeness of monstrous Beasts

or Ghosts of their deceased Friends. They are moreover often abetted
to tempt and provoke melancholy people to execute themselves ;
besides innumerable wayes they have of executing the pleasures of
[» .wV] *iniquous Spirits through malicious Instigations, and secret Stratagems

projected by them to the destruction of mortal men, especially when
the work to be effected by the Devil is too too hard for his subtle and
spiritual nature to bring to pass, because the same belongs to the
Astral source or outward principle to which these dubious Spirits do
properly belong ; then are they frequently sollicited to mediate in such
treacherous actions, as the hellish Spirits have conspired against the
Lives of mortal men.
Why the devil -jo. More particularly, These Spirits that belong to the fiery Element,

help. are most officious in this kinde of service, being naturally such as the

Antecedent matter hath sufficiently demonstrated ; but according to
the ranks and Categoryes to which they belong, some of them are
more inveterate, and malicious in their undertakings then the rest.
But every kinde of Astral Spirit is obsequious to the Kingdome of
darkness, that the devilish Spirits can effect little or nothing without
their assistance in this external principle of the Starrs and Elements
upon the bodies or possessions of Mankind ; because their bodies are

too crude and rough for the conveyance of their influence, either in
Dreams, Raptures, Phikres, Charms, or Constellations, as the follow-
ing Chapter of the nature of Infernal beings shall make plain, wherein
the nature and capacity of every damned Spirit is decyphered
according to the truth of the antient Philosophy.

31. Leave we now the Spirits of the fire, to illustrate the natures of Subterranean
subterranean Beings, whose Orders, Species, and Degrees, are various; '""'^'
for they consist in these distinctions, vis. Spirits of men deceased,
Souls of men deceased, separated Spirits Astral, separate Spirits
semi- Infernal, Spirits appropriate to the Constellations where any of
the seven metals, viz. Saturn, Jupiter, Mars, Sol, Lima, Venus,
Mercury, are found in the bowels of the Earth ; and as farr as the
natures of Minerals are distinct one from the other, so much distant
are these Subterranean Spirits in Nature and Faculty in respect of
their places, shapes, names, and qualities.

32. But they are not all confined unto the metallick Kingdome ; for Spirits of the
there are also Spirits of the Mountains, Vallies, Caves, Deeps, Hiata's, caves.^and
or Chasma's of the Earth, hidden Treasures, Tombs, Vaults, and Tombs.
Sepultures of the Dead. To the last belong the Astral Spirits of
deceased Mortals, that delight to hover over the antient Carcases to
which they belong'd, seeking still to be dissolved, and diligently
enquiring the Cause of their retention ; such are resident in silent
Caves, and solitary Vaults, where the deceased lie till the Humidum
Radicale be exciccate, and totally dryd up, after which their tricks
are no more manifest, but are utterly extinguished, and annihilated.

33. To the next, belong such Spirits as are Protectors of hidden
Treasures, from a natural Cause, from whence they do exceedingly
envy mans benefit, and accomodation in the discovery thereof, ever
haunting such places where money is conceal'd, and retaining malevo-
lent and poysonous Influences, to blast the Lives and Limbs of those
that dare to attempt the discovery thereof : Peters of Devonshire with
his confederates, who by Conjuration attempted to dig for such
defended Treasures, was crumbled into Atonies, as it were, being
reduced to Ashes with his Companions in the twinkling of an eye.

34. And upon this particular, we have plenty of Examples of the The nature of
destruction of such as by Magical experiments have discovered hidden ^"'^'^ Spirits.
Treasures ; which instances do rather seem to prove, That such as

haunt these places do more nearly belong to the Infernal, then to the
Astral Hierarchy, in regard that they are so infesting and inveterate
to Mortal men, that the Grand Intention of the Prince of darkness
may be accomplished in their designs.

35. But of all the rest such as haunt Mines and mettle men, are the 56.Spiritsthatin-
most pernicious, and frequent from the same Cause with the former. Miners.



Spirits of hid-
den Treasures.

Book II.



A Discou7'se concerning



An Example
of a turbulent
Spirit.



Conclusion,



The nature of such is very violent ; they do often slay whole Companies
of Labourers, they do sometimes send inundations that destroy both the
Mines, and Miners, they bring noxious and malignant vapours to stiile
the laborious workmen ; briefly, their whole delight and faculty con-
sists in tormenting, killing, and crushing men that seek such Treasures,
that mankind may never partake thereof to relieve their Cares, and
worldly necessities.

36. Such was Ancebergius a most virulent Animal that did utterly
confound the undertakings of those that laboured in the richest Silver
mine in Gerinatiy, called Corona Rosacea. He would often shew him-
self in the likeness of a he-goat with Golden horns, pushing down the
workmen with great violence, sometimes like a Horse breathing flames,
and pestilence at his Nostrils. At other times he represented a Monk
in all his Pontificalilnis^ flouting at their Labour, and imitating their
Actions with scorn and dedignation, till by his daily and continued
molestation he gave them no further ability of perseverance.

il. Thus, I have hinted the various distinctions, and sub-distinc-
tions of Astral Spirits proper or common, illustrating their natures
according to the opinions of the Learned ; from thence I proceed to
say what the Infernal Hierarchy is, and whereof it doth consist in this
fifth Chapter following.

Eaving the Astral Kingdome, I will now proceed to describe
the natures, and distinctions of Infernal Spirits or Devils, and
damned Souls, who are to be considered according to their
ranks, and orders, exactly correspondent to the Quires, and Hierarchies
of the Angels, or Celestial beings, wherein I will insist upon their
names, shapes, places, times, orders, powers, and capacities, proceed-
ing gradually from a general narration, to a particular Anatomy of
every sort of Spirit in its proper place and order.

2. As for the Locality or Circumscription of the Kingdome of dark-
ness, it is farr otherwise to be considered then the vulgar account it,
who esteem the hellish habitation, a distinct Chasma or Gulph in a

Chap. V.

certain place, above, under, or in the Center of the Earth, where in-
numerable Devils, and wicked Souls inhabit, who are perpetually
scorched, and tormented with material flames of fire. This is the
opinion which naturally all men are addicted and prone unto. But if
we will rightly consider the Kingdomeof Heaven and Hell, in respect
of one another, we must look upon the similitude of light and darkness
in this outward world, who are not circumscribed, nor separate as to
Locality from one another ; for when the sun arises, the darkness of
the night disappeareth, not that it removes it self to some other place
or Country, but the brightness of the light overpovvereth it, and
swallows it up, so that though it disappeareth, yet it is as really there
as the light is.

3. This is also to be considered in*the description of the Habitations
of good, or evill beings, that they are really in one another, yet not
comprehended of one another, neither indeed can they be, for the
evil Spirits if they should remove ten thousand miles, yet are they in
the same quality and source, never able tofinde out or discover where
the Kingdome of Heaven is to be found, though it be really through,
and through with the dark Kingdome, but in another quality which
makes them strangers to one another.

4. A similitude hereof we have in the faculties of the humane Life,
as to the indowments of the Soul considered in the just, and in the
wicked ; for to be good, pure, and holy, is really present as a quality
in potentia with the depraved soul, although at that instant the Soul
be cloathed with Abominations, so that the eye which should behold
God or Goodness is put out. Yet if the soul would but come out of
it self, and enter into another source or principle, in the center it
might come to see the Kingdome of Heaven within it self, according
to the Scripture, and Moses, \Tie word is nigJi thee, in thy heart, and
in thy Mouth.

5. True it is that the Devils and damned Souls cannot sometimes
manifest themselvs in this Astral World, because the nature of some
of them is more near unto the external quality then of others, so that
although properly the very innermost and outermost darkness be
their proximate abode, yet they do frequently flourish, live, move, and
germinate in the Aery Region, being some of them finite and deter-
minate Creatures.

6. But according to their fiery nature, it is very difficult for them to
appear in this outward world, because there is a whole principle or
gulph betwixt them, to wit, they are shut up in another quality or
existence, so that they can with greater difficulty finde out the being
of this World, or come with their presence into the same, then we can
remove into the Kingdome of Heaven, or Hell with our intellectual

man ; for if it were otherwise, and that the Divels had power to
appear unto Mortals as they list, how many Towns, Cities, &^c. should
be destroyed, and burnt to the ground, how many Infants should be
kild by their malicious power ! yea few or none might then escape in
Lives, or Possessions, and sound minds, whereas now all these enjoy-
ments are free amongst mortals, which proves, that it is exceeding
hard for evill Spirits to appear in the third principle of this world, as
for a man to live under water, and fishes on the Land. Yet must we
grant, that when the imaginations, and earnest desires of some
particular Wizards, and envious Creatures have stirr'd up the center
of Hell within themselvs, that then the Devil hath sometimes access
to this world in their desires, and continues here to vex, and torment
so long as the strength of that desire remains which was the first
attractive Cause.

7. For the very cause of the paucity of appearances in these dayes,
is the fulness of time, and the brightness of Christianity, dispelling
such mists, as the sun doth cause the clouds to vanish, not by any
violence or compulsion, but from a natural cause ; even so the King-
dome of Light as it grows over mans soul, in power and dominion,
doth naturally close up the Center of darkness, and scatter the
influences of the Devil so that his tricks lye in the dust, and his will at
length becomes wholly passive as to man.

8. In the time of the Law, when the wrath and jealousie of the
Father, had the dominion in the Kingdom of Nature, all Infernal
Spirits had more easie access unto mankind then now they have ; for
before the Incarnation of Christ, the anger of God had more dominion
over the soul of Man, and was more near in nature unto the same ; so
that the Devils could with more facility spring up in the element of
Wrath, to manifest themselves in this outward principle, because the
very Basis and Foundation of Hell beneath, is built and composed of
the Wrath of God, which is the channel to convey the Devil into this
sublunary World.

9. But when Christ began to be manifest unto the World, the
multiplicity of Appearances, and possessed with Devils, began insen-
sibly to decay and vanish. And if any should object, That betwixt
the space of his Incarnation and his Sufferijtg, such accidents were
rather more freqttent than in the times before: To this I answer.
That the Devil knowing well that his time was but short ; and also
knowing, that till the great Sacrifice was offered up, he had leave to
range and rove abroad the Kingdom of this World ; therefore he
imployed all his forces and endeavours to torment those miserable
souls and captives to whom Christ came to Preach Deliverance.

10. But after the Partition wall was broken down, and the vail of

Moses., and of the anger of God from off the soul in the death of Christ,
there was a sensible and visible decay of the Devils prancks amongst
mortals, and that little remnant of Lunaticks and Possessed, which 58.
continued after Christ, did the Apostles relieve and set at liberty,
through the influence and virtue of the promise of the Son of God (to
wit) the Holy Ghost, or the Comforter, which could not come until he
went away : And on the day of Pefttecost, whilst they waited in
humility for the fulfilling of his promise, the very effect of Christs
birth and sufferings did first manifest it self, when the Holy Ghost
sprung up amongst them, to the destruction of Sin and Satan.

11. And so long as the purity of Christianity continued in the Under Aposta-
Primitive Church, there were very few that the Devil could personally

or actually lay hold of in the Astral Man, for the space of two hun-
dred years after the death of Christ, until that from Meekness and
Abstinence, the Christians began to exalt themselves in Loftiness
and Worldly Honours ; then the Devil began to exalt his head
amongst the Lip-Christians, bewitching them into every Lust ; and
captivating their inward and outward faculties at his pleasure. As
all along in Popery is clearly seen.

12. Yet notwithstanding, the coming of Christ hath prevented the Under idoia-
Devils force in general. Such Nations as have never embraced the
Christian Faith, are still deluded and bewitched by him ; because

the center hath never been actually awakened in any of them, so
that the Devils power prevails over them mightily, to seduce them to
worship things visible, and not the true God : For where the most
darkness is in Religion and Worship, or in natural understanding,
there his power is most predominant ; As in Tartary, China, and
the East-Indies ; also in Lapland, Finland, and the Northern
Islands.

13. In the West-Indies or America, his access is very facil and How power in

were at the first discovery thereof, become so much substitute and
obsequious to his power, that though they knew him to be a power
of Darkness, yet they adored him lest he should destroy them and
their Children. And unto such a height were they come at the Land-
ing of Cortes, Drake, and Vandernort, that they could familiarly
convert themselves into Wolves, Bears, and other furious Beasts ; in
which Metamorphosis their Enthusiasms and Divinations were
suggested, and such were held in greatest esteem.

14. Till upon the Invasion of the Spaniards, the greater evil drove His power in

did both depopulate the Islands and most of the Continent ; and

the race of such as addicted themselves to this infamous sort of
Divination. In which devastation, and bloody inquisition, their Idols
were discovered with their Oracles and Inchantments, far different
from the European Conjurers, and any of their Ceremonies.

15. But that which is the most remarkable in the Infernal proceed-
ings, is this. That there is not any Nation under the Sun, but the
Devil hath introduced himself amongst them through their Cere-
monies and Worship, though quite opposite to one another : For in
the Kingdom of China, by the sacrifice of Blood and Panaak, he is
Conjured and Exorcized through the repetitions of several Super-
stitious Invocations to the Sun and Moon. In Tartary the Magicians
go quite another way to work, with Offerings to the Ocean, to the
Mountains, and the Rivers, fuming Incense, and divers sorts of
Feathers ; by which means the Devils are compelled to appear. So
that we see how this Proteus can dispose himself in the divers King-
doms of this World ; being called by other names in Tartary, China,
the ^aj and West-Indies, &lc. then amongst the European Conjurers.
Likewise the Greeks and Romans could Invocate Spirits by Prayers
unto the Moon, and divers Sacrifices of Milk, Honey, Vervine, and
Blood. And those that are addicted to Conjurations in Christianity,
have attained to a more lofty and ample manner of Incantation and
Conjuring with Magical Garments, Fire, Candles, Circles, Astrologi-
cal Observations, Invocations, and holy Names of God, according to
the Kaballa of theewsl

16. So that every distinct Nation hath conformed its Conjuration
unto the Ceremonies of that Religion which it professeth : And it is
to be observed, That from a natural cause every Nation hath its
Conjurations and Names of Devils, from the Constellation under
which the Countrey lyeth, and from the Air or Wind to which such
particular Dominations do belong ; so that no effect would follow, if
one Countrey should traditionally inure themselves to the Forms and
Exorcisms that are used by another Nation. And therefore is it that
so many attempts are offered in vain amongst professed Christians to
raise Spirits, because they have little or nothing from their own
Constellation, but make use of what they have borrowed from the
Greeks and Romans, or the ancient Imbecillity of the ^Egyptians
Priests ; I mean, their simple forms of Invocation.

17. But because we are rather upon the discovery of the Infernal
Kingdom, as it hath no dependence upon the doings of mortal Men ;
therefore we will proceed to discover what the Antients have said
concerning it : So the next which we fall upon after the descrip-
tion of their Habitations, and the manner of their Appearances, is
their Names and Appellations diversly considered. First, from the



Devils and Spirits.

according to the scctiluin under which they were Invocated ; assum-
ing names according to the present occasion about which they were
imployed.

18. Under the Constellation of China, they are Invocated by the Ti
Names l^aw, ^inoam, flantam, ISal, Baltal, Sfjrall, the six Governours
or Presidents : (fTfjanrailfjian, the chief of the Devils : ^o, lUai)in,
flalfeill, flcto, the Devils of the four Winds : Urail, Um, ^ntl, Siial, the
Devils of the four Elements. And according to the nature of their
language or words which do all consist of no more then one syllable,

so are the Devils named. Yea, as it is conjectured by many learned
Magicians, this language of the Chinenses is more Magical and adap-
ted to Conjurations, then all 'the Oriental Tongues, h&zz.ws,Q. of the
consonancy and copiousness thereof, together with the numerous and
various Characters used by them.

19. \n\h& East-l7idies,2^\di\n Tartary, the Names are the same in i^ ■^'"■s'
with those of China, though the Ceremonies differ. In Persia, Arabia, TarUka.
Natalia, j-Egypt, ^Ethiopia, the Names are the same with th.^ Jezuish
Rabbins. But the Greeks and Ronans have different from the rest,
according to their Language and Superstitions. The Turks, Mtisco-
vites, Russians, Lapponians, and Norwegians, make use of the
Sclavofiian tongue in all their Conjurations. The West-hidians
have very strange and antick Names and Ceremonies of their own,
nothing depending on the Traditions and Practices of the old World ;
for, as is related before, the Devil is sufficiently capable of introduc-
ing himself through the Religious Superstitions of any Nation whom-
soever, according to the Constellations, although strangers to the
Rites and Ceremonies of others.

20. But though their Names be conformable to the Language and
Climate of that Nation where they are raised or called ; yet have
they divers Names, suppose twenty or thirty to one Devil, according
to the several ministrations they have had from the Creation to this
day, leaving a several name behinde them at each of their appear-
ances upon the earth ; for, according to the testimony of the Devil
himself, if credit may be given to Devils, they, as they are abstrac-
tively considered in their own Kingdom, have no imposed Names of
distinction, but are forced to assume them when they rise up in the
external principle of this World : although in some measure it must
be granted, that there be some principal Kings and Dukes in the
Infernal Hierarchy, that have Names establish'd upon them which
cannot be transferr'd or altered.

of Witchcraft by Reginald Scot Esq ; being a Catalogue of Devils
in their Kancks and Hierarchies, they are supposed to be fictitious
and totally imaginary, being taken out of Bodin or IVycns, which
they recorded from the mouth of Tradition, and obscure Manuscrips :*
And indeed were there any certainty in this List of Devils, it were to
be preferred as the most ample and exact delineation that is extant.
But it is the rather to be suspected, because of the little coherence
it hath with the former received Names of Devils eitheir in Europe,
Asia, Africa, or America.

22. But if we would speak of Damned Souls and their Names or
Appellations, they are farr otherwise to be considered then the Devils;
for such as their imposed Names were here on earth, such is the
Name they have in the Kingdom of Darkness, after a Magical manner,
according to the language of nature in the first principle of Dark-
ness ; as the Saints in heaven retain their Names in a Ccelestial
manner : And also, as the Astral Spirit of a Man deceased, retains
its antient Name according to the Astral source in the principle of
the one only Element.

23. For as the language of Natui'e is found in the second Principle,
it is likewise manifest in the dark Worlds property, according to the
first Principle of Wrath ; as also the monstrous shapes of Devils
and Damned Souls is correspondent to the Magical postures of their
Souls whilst they were alive ; of which I shall speak more largely
when their Shapes are to be described. According unto which, as
also according to the rest of their attributes, vis. their Raiicks, Num-
bers, Times, Po%uers, Places, &c. their Names are fitted and conformed
according to the uniformity of name and thing in the principles of
the eternal and external nature.

24. And as all other Nations have their various Appellations for
Devils and Damned Souls, like their natural tone or language ; so we
can mention one Kingdom more admirable then the rest, viz. the
Kingdom of Fiacim at the Northern Pole, where all the Counsellors
are Magicians ; and the Names which they use in Invocations, are
Mathematically disposed in a wonderful harmony and efficacy, to the
performance of Magical operations. So much of the Places and
Names of Infernal Beings ; the next to be considered is their Shapes
and Likenesses.

25. The Shapes of Devils are answerable to the cause of their
Fall, and the Dominions to which they belong. Those that belong
to the Supreme Hierarchy, when they are called by Magicians, do at
first appear in the form of fierce and terrible Lyons, vomiting fire,
and roaring hideously about the Circle ; from thence they convert
themselves into Serpents, Monkies, and other Animals, till the Magi-



Devils and Spirits. chap, v. 525

cian do repeat the form of Constriction or Confinement to a Trine or
Triangle, as before is mentioned in the Fifteenth Book of the Dis-
covery.

26. After the Conjuration is repeated, they forsake these bestial As they appear
shapes, and *indow the humane form at first like troops of Armed {„ the highest
Men ; till at last by frequent repetitions of other Ceremonies, they '■•■'"'^•
appear as naked Men of gentle countenance and behaviour. Yet is '■* ^ '"^^e]
the Magician to take care that they deceive him not by insinuations ;

for their fraudulency is unspeakable in their appearance and dealings
with Mankind ; because we may be assured they appear not willingly,
but are by forceable Conjurations compelled : so that they will ever
minde their own ends in medling with man ; that is, to deprave his
minde, or subvert the Lives and Estates of others through his means
and assistance.

27. The rest of the Infernal Dominions have various appearances, in the lower

and Beasts, as Leopards, Tygers, Pecocks, &^c. But by Conjurations

they may be likewise reduced to a Manlike form, wherein they will

shew him a pair of Crocodiles jaws, or a Lyons paw, with other

ing to the division of the clean and unclean Beasts in the Law given raWe "to Ihe^^

Kingdom : So that the most perverse and potent amongst the Devils
represent the most ugly and mischievous amongst the Beasts, accord-
ing to this following division ; vis. such Devils as SlStarotf), iLucifrr,

Uarion, tJotonofe, who incline men and instigate them to pride and
presumptuousness, have the shapes of Horses, Lyons, Tygars, Wolves
Such as instigate to Lust and Covetousness have the forms of Hogs,
Serpents, and other filthy reptiles or envious Beasts, as Dogs, Cats,
Vultures, Snakes, &^c. Such as incline to Murther, have the shapes
of every Bird and Beast of prey. Such as Answer Questions humane
in Philosophy, or Religion, have more tolerable shapes, almost manly,
but with crooked Noses, like Mermaids, or Satyres. And of all the
rest it is to be observed, that as not one single Lust or Vice hath
dominion without mixture in the evil Spirits, so they are not of a
distinct shape lik one single Beast, but compounded into Monsters,
with Serpents-tails, four eyes, many feet and horns, ^-'c.

29. And as in general, these are the shapes of Devils, so the par-
ticular shapes of Damned Souls are to be considered in the same
manner with the rest, only with this difference, that they are more
addicted to metamorphose themselves and vary their appearances.
Though, for the most part, the Damned Souls retain the humane shape
after a Magical manner, so that the greatest part of that numberless
number are in their antient shapes, especially when they appear in
sleep to their surviving acquaintance. Their aspects are very dismal
and melancholy like the Ghosts of the Astral source.

30. Now to speak of the Times and Seasons of their Appearance.
The better sort of Magicians to square their times with Astrological
hours, especially of Sattifu, Lima, and Venus, in the Moons increase,
and the middle of the night, or twelve a clock at noon : In which
hours they do likewise compose their Garments, Caps, Candlesticks,
Figures, Lamins, Pentacles, and Circles for Conjuration. As for the
Times in respect of their Infernal Courses, the fittest are when they
spring up in the Wrath, or when they sink in the Dispair, which is a
mystery to the learned Conjurers of Europe.

31. In respect of this exterior World, they can most easily appear
in solitary places, when the Sun is down ; for they are naturally at
enmity with the Sun, because it stands as a type of the Mediator, or
Heart and Centre which they lost utterly in their fall, and now are
destitute of, like a wheel without an axletree. And indeed, the want
of this is the chief cause of all their torment, and of the rising of the
gnawing Worm, when they consider of their irrevocable sentence, and
irrecoverable loss.

32. In storms of Hail, or Snow, Wind, Tempest, and Lightning, is
accounted amongst Magicians, a time for Conjuring at an easie rate.
And they say, That such Ceremonies will prove very effectual, if a
Conjurer begin his Exorcisms in the hour and day of Luna, in the
middest of a furious storm of Lightning, Rain, and Thunder, in a low
Vault or Celler that is close and retired. Also when the Wind blows
high, without Rain, they say, the Devils are more near the Kingdom
of this World, and may with great facility be soUicited or raised at
such a season, because they delight in all extremities of weather,
being themselves the first cause of the disorder of the properties in
the Kingdom of Nature.

33. But in some Countries they can more easily appear then in
others, according to the Constellations, for they delight much in the
extremities of the two Poles toward Lapland, Nova Zenibla, Green-
land, Tartary ; and in the South towards the Islands scattered
about the confines of Terra Lncognita. They are likewise easily
Invocated on the shoar amongst lofty Rocks and Precipices, or in

Deserts and Wildernesses far from Towns or Inhabitants. And it is 62.
said, they do much respect the motion of the Seas in their appearance
unto such as solicite them in places Maritime or Plagiary.

34. As for their Rancks or Orders, there is some difficulty in the Their Ranks
true discovery thereof, by reason that we know not certainly of what

Orders they were that Fell. The opinion of most men is, That of
every Order many fell. But those that better know the nature of the
Heavenly Hierarchies, have sufficiently proved, That of any Ranch or
Order none can fall nnless all do follow. Therefore with more reason
may it be judged. That before the Devils fell, the Hierarchy of Heaven
did consist of three Rancks or Orders ; to wit, the Order of 5SricI, of
iiWiri^arl, of JLurifrv : That of Hurifrr is totally in Hell: The other
which is under i'Ht'rljafl, is the dominion of Heaven : The last which
is ?Brif Is, are more in the dominion of this third principle of the Stars,
having the Planets in their dominion, with the influences thereof.

35. So that the foregoing Catalogue, transcribed by the Author of in three disUn-
\\\\'s> Discovery, is utterly feigned and fictitious, because it makes these

many sorts of Devils to have Dominion over several Legions in several
distinctions of Seraphims, Powers, Thrones, Dominations, Chernbims,
&c. Whereas the whole Kingdom of Hell consists but of one only
Hierarchy, which is that of liufifrr and his Legions, reduced by their
exorbitances into that Lacrymable posture wherein they now are and
shall be for ever. Which Doctrine seriously weigh'd will prove the
attempts of Conjurers and Magicians to be utterly vain, and their
forms of Invocation vanity and falshood.

36. Their number may be thought upon more narrowly, if we con- Their num-
sider that they consist of one Hierarchy and no more ; yet must we
confess that the limit is not to be put thereunto, because their nature

is to Germinate and Multiply as they please, contracting and dilating
themselves according to the force of their imaginative powers and
faculties. But although this be granted, yet there is a setled number
of Devils that varyeth not. Though of Damned Souls the number is
numberless and unfathomable ; yet as to their extent of room or place,
it is never the more because of their multitude, they being able to truss
a thousand Legions into the carcass of a man. As for the opinions of
Authors, they are various ; it is believed by some. That the Starrs are
answerable to their member ; others speak of tJie Sands iipon the Sea-
shore : however it be, this is certain. They are even innumerable in
respect of Jnimane Capacities.

2,7. Their Natures are now to be considered as they belong to the Their natures
hellish source or quality. In themselves they rest not, neither are ^" properties,
they capable of the length or shortness of time, nor of the alternate
courses of day and night. The wickedness which they committed in

this life, are their continual torment, which do Magically gnaw and
corrode them, rising and boyling up perpetually within them, all the
refrigeration which they have, is by intercourse when the height of
Wickedness begins to stirr them in blasphemies against God, and
towring up above heaven and goodness, in their adulterated Imagina-
tions, which is unto them as sport and pastime with one another, and
lasteth such a space as with us makes up forty minutes. Neither
Their torments doth this any whit advantage them, but rather adds to their torment ;
for pain discontinued is the greater : neither would vexation be vexa-
tion, if it had no respite or forbearance ; That the contrary might be
also manifest. Nam cotitrariajuxta se positamajjcs eliicesctint. Yet is
their torment exceedingly different, so that the torment of one, in respect
of another, is but a Dream or Phansie ; I mean, amongst the Damned
Souls, and not the Devils, for the pain and sorrow of the Devils is
greater then the greatest of the lost Souls, by many thousand degrees,
according to the course of nature and reason ; for that which falls
highest, suffers most, and optima corrtipta Jiunt pessima.l

38. But wonderful and manifold are the torments which all in
general of the Infernal troops, do suffer according to the various lusts
they reigned in whilst they lived upon the earth. The cruel Murtherers
that died in the boyling source of blood and envy, their torment is the
greatest, they are continually Murthering in their imaginations, and
seeking, like dreaming men, to do what the want of the Organ will not
suffer them ; for according to the saying of the wisest upon this Sub-
ject, this is the torment and misery of all the Damned, That they are
continually wishing and wonlding j and in ivoitldings they generate
Ideas and representations, which are the species of their continual
aggravations and deceiving phansies.

39. Those that were buryed in Lust and Gluttony, Drunkenness and
Lasciviousness, are also in miserable torments, yet much inferiour to
the first ; they are continually imagining their former pleasures in the
Magia as in a dream, which when they wake, torments them cruelly ;
they are often hanging, stabbing, and mangling themselves for love,
and perpetually sinking down in sorrow and despair, if they were such
as died in love, or in the height of their Astral affections, leaving
behind them a heap of desires and lusts, which are the only cause of
all their torment. And we may well compare the passions of Melan-
choly persons, or such as in Deserts, Woods, and Mountains, pine
away for love of Women, unto their torments ; which indeed being
the trouble of the mind, are absolutely the greatest and heaviest that
the source or property of this World affordeth, I mean, the perturba-
tions of the minde in general.

Their torment 40. Such souls in whom the boyling source of Anger and Rage,

hath had a dwelling or receptacle, if they depart unmortified, do also
enter into a most dreadful kind of torment, which continually ariseth
as a biting Worm and hungry fire to double and accumulate the
excess of despair upon them, if they have much domineered therein
whilst they lived in this World. Also these that reigned in Pride and
Envy, are ever seeking to pluck God from his Throne, and towring up
in their Imaginations, as men that dream, still seeking for the King-
dom of heaven, to insult and boast therein ; but the quality thereof is
utterly occult and estranged from them ; so that they can never finde,
taste, hear, nor see it, though it be through and through with their
own peculiar principle. This adds perpetually to their misery, and
ariseth at times with horrible pangs and gnawings, like the irksome
and vexatious pains and aches subject to Mans body, which cease
a while and then begin to shoot and ake by intercourse, as the Gowt,
Tooth-ach, Head-ach, Convulsion, Gripings, and the Stone.

41. Thus' their torments are in brief described, but indeed the
capacity of Man is not able to reach the description of their cruel
miseries, and continual pangs which they contracted upon themselves;
for every faculty is sufficiently plagued. The Sence of Hearing is
disturb'd with harsh and rugged sounds, which are as an antipathy
to that Organ ; as rough and scraping sounds externally offend the
ears, and set the teeth on edge, by affecting the tender fibres of the
same. Their Sight is likewise cruelly offended and affrighted with
monstrous appearances and Ideas represented continually to their
imaginations. And there is not any loathsome taste in the Kingdome
of this World, either Animal, Vegetative, or Mineral, which they are
at any time void of, being continually pestered and suffocated with
filthy fumes and smoaks of hellish fruits, as of Sulphurean stinks, and
abominations.

42. Neither are the other Sences of the Touch and Smell behind
in participation of the like Torments, which their own iniquities do
perpetually excite and create unto them ; besides, they are ever
vexing one another ; and if any be in the same misery with whom
they had acquaintance here on *eath, the very Magical knowledge,
and perceivance, or remembrance thereof, doth beyond utterance or
conception, most miserably afflict and macerate their Souls and all
their Sences.

43. For the nature of their habitation is such, that their torment is
exceedingly aggravated thereby, because the extremity of the four
Elements is there converted into a whole Principle of wrath and
vexation. The excess of cold and heat, drought and moisture, are
continually raging amongst them by intercourse. Neither is there
any light or lustre to be seen within their Courts, but that which

comes from their fiery Eyes, as a deadly <;lance or glimmering, being
sudden fiery flashes and sparkling, as the enkindling of Gunpowder,
or Aiiruni ful))iinans for a similitude.

44. And as every kinde of Being feeds upon somewhat of its own
nature, property, and element, whither it be Plant, Animal, or
Metalline kinde ; so the Devils are neither destitute of meat, drink,
nor cloathing, according to their own Kingdom and quality, having
fruits springing and growing before them of hellish, sour and
poysonous natures, which are real and palpable unto them, and not
imaginary or typical, though to us magical and invisible ; neither is
this to be Avondered at, if we consider the nature of Man's Soul, In
iMedia Nahira ; for if it feed not upon the internal* and substantial
Word, which is the very Bread of Life it self, it must of necessity rumi-
nate on something else, viz. the fruits of Iniquity, which it takes in
and drinketh up as the Oxe drinks water, so that to the soul the sin
becomes palpable, glutting, and satiating ; yea, so substantial unto
the Soul, as Dirt or Ink upon fair white Linnen is to our external
Eyes ; neither can the Soul be freed from these spots till the water
above the Firmament wash them away.

45. Also in respect of the Astral source they are not destitute of
food, when they bring themselves into the same ; for the gas of
the air and bias of the water is their nourishment, while they stay
here, as is before alledged : These influences of the air and water
they take into their Limbiis, and convert into their own poysonous
natures ; as of sweet and wholsome herbs the filthy Toads and other
venemous Beasts do make their poyson, converting them into a nature
like themselves. And on the contrary, the poysonous herbs are con-
verted into good and wholesome nourishment by other cleanly
Beasts.

46. And as the Infernal Troops are considered in respect of the four
Elements, they have a distinct and peculiar tone or language, which
they exercise and speak one amongst one another, as mortals do.
But they have utterly lost the dignity of their sounds according to the
eternal nature. And are likewise totally corrupted in their pro-
nouncing, or Dialect, since they fell from their first cEelestial glory ;
so that their speech is harsh, doleful, and terrible, like the fruits they
feed upon, and the life they dwell in. Which depravation is very
apparent in the Kingdom of this World in the divided Languages of
every Region, according to the Constellation under which they are
situated : The true and magical Language of nature being hid from
all the Countreys of the earth.

47. But when they appear in the outward Elements, they do many
times express themselves in Irish, H'elch, Intine ; or Ritssinjt, which

are the Languages most affected by them to answer unto Conjurations,
or Compacts. So that if any Magician, who is ignorant of these
aforesaid Languages do at any time Raise or Exorcise such Spirits,
he must be mindful to confine them to his mother tongue ; least their
gibberish prove altogether unintelligible ; for as every thing appears
in what it most affecteth, or is addicted to ; even so the Spirits have
their distinct affections, passions, and postures, both in word, habit,
shape, and gesture ; so that the Magician must be wary in Exorcizing
with them, that he confine them to a different place, posture, shape,
and language, to answer their intentions without impediment.

48. For they are very variable and unconstant in their dealings Their uncon-
with mankind, nor will they stand to any thing that hath not bound ^'^''"'^>'-
them by the obligations of Words, Characters, and Imprecations,

except the skill of the Exorcist be such, that he is able to confine
them into a Magical Triad, which hath the certain force of obliging
or compelling them to utter truth, and nothing false in all their 65.
Answers, or Informations. But with such miserable men and women
as they have made Covenants and Indentures for body, soul, and
works ; with such I say, they keep no faith, nor are they lyable to their
commands ; but on the contrary, have them hampered and subjected
to their will and power, till they have terminated their lives in their
destruction.

49. Yet have not any of the most potent Princes in the Hellish Their Power.
Power, the least ability to destroy the least of the sons of men, with-
out the consent of the mind and senses of the Soul ; for until the

will of the Soul be opened unto him, his threatnings, sleights and
stratagems are without any power or force, as the nerves of a dead
man. Although naturally every evil Spirit boasteth, as if all the
world were at its command, and every Soul were subject to its
authority and beck, with the Goods or Possessions of the external
World.

50. When any evil Spirit is raised up by Conjurations, without when ihey are
League, or Compact ; these Spirits so raised, are exceeding fraudulent '^^^''^'' "'''
and deceitful, as stubborn servants that do their Masters will by
constraint,andnotbyany natural act of obedience unto his Commands.

But with such as they have compacted, they are frequent and officious,
imploying them as Agents for the destruction of others and their
substance : and being marryed unto such, they are even become one
with them, being incorporated into them, so that they are nothing
different from incarnate Devils, save that the spark of divine Light,
which was the gift of God unto repentance, is not totally eradicated
until the body fall away.

51. From such as Covenant with these unconstant Spirits, do they Fumigations



532

The Conclusi-



daily obtain Fumigations, Odours, and Offerings, or Sacrifices of
Blood, Fire, Wine, Ointments, Incense, Fruits, Excrements, Herbs,
Gums, Minerals, and other Ingredients, by which from a Magical
cause, they have more influence and authority over the bewitched
party to insinuate into their affectfon, peircing even through their
bones and marrow, till they have so habituated them to their service,
that the same becomes their daily bread and sole delight in accom-
plishing every villany and abomination which the malicious and
subtle instigation of Satan leads them to.

52. Thus have I Essayed to illustrate the Natures of Infernal
Beings, which notwithstanding is a Subject so intricate and copious in
it self, that great difficulty accompanies the Explication thereof ; by
reason of the variety of their natures in the source of darkness,
wherein they live, move, eat, breath, and inhabit, having qualities,
actions, and passions innumerable, to us men-kinde utterly unknown
and incomprehensible : So that to attempt an ample demonstration
of this present Subject, would require deeper speculation then the
matter doth deserve, in regard that there be so many Protei and
Changlings in that gloomy Kingdom, who do never stay or con-
tinue in the same nature, property, and form for an hour together ;
but may be compared to the swiftness of the Windes, or the likeness
and form of swift running Waters, that pass away as a thought ; and
are no more remembered. So it is with the Spirits of Darkness,
whose life is a meer anguish and inconstancy from one sorrow to
another unto all Eternity.

Order of Thrones, with the seven Planets, and their Magical Charac-
ters in the Center, they proceeded to the Ceremonies of Conjuration
after they had frequently repeated the forms of calling, and nothing
as yet appeared ; they were grown so desperate therein, that forsaking
the Circle, and every defensive Character or Ceremony, they at last
betook themselves to the most accursed and detestable branch of
Magick, which consists of Compacts, or Confederacy ; and having by
a solemn League summoned the aforesaid Spirit laofeim, they obtain'd

in every Countrey. By the help of this Magician the Tartars did

destroy above 100 sail of Ships belonging unto China ; many losses
did he bring upon that Kingdom in their Children, Fruits, Corn, Silk,
and Navigation ; he could frequently transport himself through the
Air, and carry in one hand a thousand pound weight, to the astonish-
ment of all that knew him. He had many publick contests with
Magicians of other Countries, being tryals of skill in Magical Art,
wherein he was said to excel all that ever went before him.

4. Such another was Lewis Gaiifridi a French Priest, who had Another Ma-
compacted with the Devil, and served him 14 years in these de- ^"^"'"'
testable works, sacrificing Infants unto him, worshipping him in a

filthy shape, and tempting others to their Magical society or nocturnal
Conventions ; in which, as it is reported, they did ever feast and junket
with varieties and dainties, which though they did seem delectable,
were yet notwithstanding gustless and unsavoury.

5. Leaving these relations, something shall be said of Charms and
Spells, as they are divided in this following manner ; first, such
Amulets as being engraven and molded in the fashion of Money, or
Coyn, do serve to provoke any one desired unto love and familiarity,
being hung about the neck in certain Planetary hours. Secondly,
Spells or Charms in Parchment with Magical Characters, as Periapts
to Cure diseases ; to make one valiant, memorative, and constant.
Thirdly, Corselets, which are an ancient Danish Charm of Neck-laces,
composed of Thunderstones ingraven with Magical Letters, to resist
all noxious influences, and the danger of Lightning.

6. Pentacles are a fourth sort of appendix, which Conjurers, Pentacks
Charmers, and Magicians use, being made with five corners, accord-
ing to the five Senses, and the operation thereof inscribed upon the
corners ; the matter whereof they are composed, is fine Linncn

cruelly tortured and amazed, being by the frequent repetition thereof
forced at last to depart by the assistance of the Exorcism of the sixth
Cannon for the order of Seraphims.

Telesms. 8. When Magicians exercise Conjuration by Moon-light in the

Mountains or Valleys, they have another sort of Charm by way of
Telesms, which they bury within a hundred paces of the place where
the Circle is composed towards the East, West, North, and Soiitli ;
For such spells have the secret power to hinder any living creature
for coming near them, till their Exercize be done, except the Infernal
Spirit, whose presence they do so ardently desire.

For Diseases. Q. Such Spclls as are made in some Edible matter, with Characters

jipoii them, are given for Agues, Head-ach, Epilepsie, Mother, &c.
Especially being powerful in operation, when the party is ignorant of
the Charm taken in ; many such I know have taken wonderful effect.
But as for Pliiltres, Potions, and Love-cups, they proceed rather from
a natural cause ; whether their effects be to afflict with Diseases to
Poyson, or to provoke unto Love of a Party whom they disdain :
Neither are such to be numbered amongst Charms ; because their
effect is meerly natural, from a natural cause.

Fumigations. lo. But to insist further upon the nature of Conjuration, Magicians

do much exercise their time in Fumigations unto those Spirits whom
they are about to provoke ; their fumes being distributed according
to the nature of the Spirit under any of the seven Planets, which the
antient Conjurers were very punctual in observing, though in these
days it be much forgot, as superfluous, or rather dangerous to insert
amongst the Ceremonies of Conjuration. A division of Fumigations
according to the Influence of the Planets, and Orders of Spirits, we
will here set down in this manner.

For Saiurn. 1 1 . Fumigations for Saturii are made of Frankincense Trees, Pepper-

^:, ^y^.j -wort Rooots,* Storax, and Galbauum; by these the Spirits itlarl)a5),Cor-

tail, §tilfeon, 11)09, &c. And all of the first order in the astringency are
appeased and provoked, when X\vq fumes are put upon a Tripod 'va the
hour of Saturn according to the Planetary division. These Fumiga-
tions make these Spirits appear like old men, with promiss beards, and
meager looks ; like Serpents, Cats, Wolves, Badgers, Panthers ; like
old Men in Armour ; like Trumpeters in many ranks and divisions.



Devils and Spurts. chap. vi. 535

12. For Spirits vm^er flip iter, they take Lignum Aloes, Ashen-Keys, Jupiter.
Benjamin, Storax, Peacocks-feathers, and Lapis Lazuli, mixing the
same with the blood of a Stork, a Swallow, or a Hart ; the brains being

also added. Theutnes are kindled in Jicpitcrs hour, and in a place
appropriate to his nature. And by this sacrifice the Spirits of the
next order are called up, like glorious Kings with many attendants,
and mighty pomp ; with Heralds before them, and Ensign-bearers,
Trumpeters, Guards, and all sorts of musical Instruments.

13. They make Fumigations unto such Spirits of the order of Mars.
Powers, as are under Mars, in the Planetary division with Aromatick
Gum, Bdellium, Euphorbium, Load-stone, Hellebore white and black,

and an addition of Sulphur to make them into an Amalgama, with
Man's blood, and the blood of a black Cat ; which mixtures are said
to be exceeding magical : so that without any other addition, they say,
\\\\% fumigation is able of it self to make such Spirits to appear before
the Exorcist; at their appearance they come with weapons brandish-
ing, and shining Armour, being terrible in their looks ; yet of power
inferiour to the Spirits of Saturn, though they can likewise shew
themselves as Lions, Wolves, Tygers, Bears, and all other cruel or
ravenous Beasts.

14. They do likewise unto the Spirits under Sol, being of the order Sol.
of Thrones, Suffumigate Saffron, Musk, Laurel, Cinnamon, Amber-
griece, Cloves, Myrrhe, and Frankincense, Musk, and the Balsamick
Tree mixed up together with the brain of an Eagle, and the blood of

a white Cock, being made up like Pills, or little Balls, and put upon
the Tripod; their appearances are Castles, Gardens, Mountains, 68.
Rivers, Fisher-men, Hunters, Reapers, Dogs, Sheep, Oxen, and other
domestick Beasts.

15. Under Venus are the Spirits of the sixth order in the Powers ; Venus.
their appearances are very stately, like the nature of the Planet ; like
Courtiers, Ladies, Princes, Queens, Infants, Children, and fragrant
smells. The fumigations appropriate unto them are Roses, Coral,
Ligjium Aloes, and Sperma d^'made up with Sparrows, brains and
blood of Pidgeons to be fumigated with a Song.

16. Mercury sendeth Horsemen, Fishers, Labourers, Priests, Mercury.
Students, Servants, &^c. Also, Foxes, Serpents, Dogs, Hares, Hyena's,
Hydra's, and other Monstrous Animals ; unto him they fumigate
Frankincense, Mastick, Cinkfoyl, incorporated with the brain of a

Fox, and the blood of a Mag-Pye.

17. Spirits under Lima are like Ghosts and shadows, very gastly to tuna.
behold ; though in humane shape sometimes male, sometimes female.
Fumigations are offered unto them of Frogs dryed, white Poppy-seed,
Bulls Eyes, Camphire, and Frankincense, incorporated with Gooses
blood, and the menstruous blood of Women.

i8. These are the divisions oi fumzgations, ■neither can it be denyed,
but that in many Ceremonies of this kind, there is great inherent
virtue according to the Doctrines of Sympathy and Antipathy,
whereby every thing is drawn by its like in the Idea, whither by words
or actions, according to the saying, In verbis, herbis 6-= lapidibus
latct virtus, so that the Ceremonies and Charms, with other circum-
stances used by Magicians, are doubtless prevalent to the accomplish-
ment of that work which they undertake ; to wit, The calling up and
Exorcizing of Infernal Spirits by Conjurations.

"B



Esides what the Author hath set down, there be many other
Spells and Charms, which Tradition hath left unto Posterity,
being many of them effectual for the thing intended by them,
as in the precedent Chapter is set down, wherein the Orders of Fumi-
gatio7is are described. Besides there are Magical Characters attri-
buted to the Planets, whereof Telesms, Periapts, Amulets, and Philters^
are composed by biiryings, writings, bindings, engraviftgs, alligations,
&c. to effect various purposes in Astrological hours. To conquer
Enemies, cure diseases, overturn Cities, stop Inundations, render
bodies Invulnerable, and the like ; which are all effected by medium's
of this kind, with the assistance of Imagination.

2. Yet are there many natural Compositions, which have very stu-
pendious effects of themselves, without assistance of Superstition ; for
the commixtion of things is of two-fold force or vertue : First, When
the Celestial vertues are duly disposed in any natural body ; so that
in one thing are couched various Influences of superiour Powers. The
second is, from Artificial mixtures and Compositions of natural things
amongst themselves, in a certain proportion to agree with the Heavens
under certain Constellations. This proceeds from the correspondence
of natural things amongst themselves, whereby things are effected even
unto admiration, as Agrippa declares. Cap. 35. lib. i.

3. And as unto every Planet certain fumigations are ascribed ; so
unto such Spirits as are under them, certain Places are adopted for
the Ceromonie§* of Conjuration, which Magicians chose when they set

upon their works of Darkness. Unto Satinii are ascribed dark
melancholy Places, Vaults, Tombes, Monasteries, empty Houses, Dens,
Caves, Pits. Unto Jupiter, Theaters, Schools, Musick houses, Judg-
ment seats. To Mars, Fields where Battels have been fought, Bake-
-houses. Glass-houses, Shambles, Places,* of Execution. To Sol,
Palaces, Mountains, Meddows, Sunshine, Groves, and upper Rooms.
To Venus, Fountains, Meadows, Gardens, and the Sea-shore. Unto
Mercury, all publick places belonging unto Cities. To Luna,
Wildernesses, Woods, Rocks, Forrests, Ships, High-wayes, &r=c.

4. In like manner are Spells and Charms adapted to the thing
which they must eftect, according to the matter, form and place of
their composition ; as for the procuring; of Love, they bury Rings,
Ribbons, Seals, Pictures, Looking-Glasses, &^c. in Stews, Baths, Beds,
that in such places they may contract some Venereal faculty : When
they gather Herbs or other Ingredients ; they chuse the hour and
place, when such Planets have Dominion as are over these Herbs,
which they collect, ever remembring to turn their faces to the East, or
South, when Saturnine, Martial or Jovial Herbs are gathered, because
their Principal houses are Southern signs ; for Venereal, Mercurial, or
Lunary herbs, they must look towards the West or North, because
their houses are chiefly Northern signs. Yet in any Solar or Lunar
operations the body of the Sun and Moon must be respected in the
operation.

5. Colours are also much regarded amongst Magicians, according Secret Con
to the Planet, as black, leaden, brown, unto Saturn ; saphire, vernal, ^ "^'""^•
green, purple, golden, unto Jupiter ; red, burning, violet, bloody, and

iron colours unto Mars ; golden, saffron, scarlet, &^c. unto the Sun ;
white, fair, green, ruddy, pleasant mixed colours unto Venus, Murcuryt
and Luna. In like manner they ascribe colours unto the twelve
Houses, and according to the Planets have also certain compositions
for fire that produce wonderful operations ; as Lamps of Serpents
skins will make Serpents to appear. Oyl that hath stood under Grapes,
being lighted, presenteth the Chamber full of Grapes. Centaury and
the Lapwings blood makes people seem like Gyants, and in the
open air will make the Stars seem to move up and down in the
Elements. The fat of a Hare lighted in a Lamp, will cause Women to
be exceeding merry and facetious. And Candles composed of things
that are Saturnine, raise terrours and melancholy in the party that
lights them, and in those that are lighted by them.

6. Such wonderful effects have natural things being fitted unto their
Hours and Constellations, as also when they are used to prove such
effects as the nature of the things doth produce of it self, though in a
weaker degree. To raise Tempests Magicians burn the Liver of a

Camtelion on the house top. To cause strange sights they hang the Gall
of a Ox over their Beds ; iohxmg Appa7-itions and Spirits, they make
a strange fume of a Mans Gall, and the Eyes of a black Cat ; Which,
Agrippa saith, he hath often made experience of. There is also a
strange Magical Candle described amongst Chyviical Kw^^ioxs, which
being lighted, foretells the death of the party to whom it belongs .•
The manner thereof is thus ; They take a good qnantity of the venal
blood liikc-ivariii as it came out of the vein, luhich being Chymically
prepared with Spirit of Wine and other Ingredients, is at last made
7ip into a Candle, ^uhich being once kiiidled, never goes out till the
death of the party whose blood it is composed of ; for when he is sick, or
in danger, it burns dim and troubled ; and when he is dead, it is quite
extinguished ; of which Composition a Learned man hath wrote an
intire Tractate, De Biolychnio, or, The Lamp of Life.

7. But to proceed to the nature of Characters, Sigils, and other
Ceremo7iies, we find that not only such as pretend to command over
all sorts of Spirits ; but also they that do make Compacts, and have
sold themselves unto him, do make use of such ; which instance is
sufficient to prove what a wise man hath asserted, that although Evil
Spirits have so blinded Mens Eyes, as to make them believe they are
defended by such Ceremonies, and that these Characters are as Muni-
tions against the Devils malignancy ; Yet these very Characters,
Sigils, Lamins, &c., are Compacts themselves, which the Devils did at
first cunningly disguise with strange Repetitions in uncouth Language.

8. So that we have grounds to believe, that none is able absolutely
without Compact to call up any Spirit. But that whosoever hath pre-
tended to be famous in the Art of Magick or Conjuration, hath (to
himself unknown) compacted with and zuorshipped the Devil, under
strange Repetitions and mystical Characters, which to him seemed to
have effects quite contrary to what they really had.

9. Neither is this to be admired, that without the Knowledge or
Consent of the Magician, a Contract is made with Evil Spirits ; when
we consider the magical strength of Words and Characters, which of
themselves can cure Diseases, pull down, infect, save, destroy, charm
and inchant without the Parties assistance, either in knowledge of the
Cause, or in belief of the Consequence or Effect.

10. But on the contrary, I could instance a multitude of Examples
of such as have spent much time in Conjurations to no purpose, still
attempting by Exorcisms and Defensive Prayers to conjure a Spirit, or
cause Personal Appearances, with severe Imprecations and powerful
Charges, and yet notwithstanding have never attain'd their purpose,
nor at any time heard, or seen any Beeing, which may be called
Spectre, or Apparition.



Devils and Spirits. chap. vii. 539

11. Which is nothing wonderful, if we minde the sympathy of things By Similitude.
in Nature, how each desires its like, and hunteth after it as the
Loadstone draws Iron ; the male coveteth the female ; the evil after

the evil, and the good after the good ; which is seen in wicked Men
and their Association, in Birds and Beasts of prey ; while on the con-
trary, the Lamb delights not in the Lyon, nor the Sheep in the society
of the Wolf ; neither doth the nature which is totally depraved and
estranged from God, care to be forced or drawn compulsively by
another contrary nature, viz. innocent, just, and harmless.

12. Neither doth it consist with natural reason. That ii? 6";'^' Exoici?ing, or
should affect the society of those that are their Enemies, who make use '^'^^ ""^ °" "
of the dreadful and holy Names of God in Conjurations to call them

up; whereas they are rather antidotes against Apparations,* as maybe I* sic\
seen in various Examples of holy Men, who by Prayers and Exorcisms
have banished Evil Spirits in all Ages, which is also further evident,
in that the very form of Dispossessijn;; and Exorcising is made up of
divers Prayers and Defensive Blessings against the obnoxious
influences of Infernal Spirits.

13. Therefore though I would be far from describing an undenyable Like desires
course of Conjuring Spirits, or of causing Apparitions : Yet this I "^ ' ^'
must assert conclusively from what is before alledged, That if any

thing would be called or wrought upon, it must be with something
which is of its own nature, as a bait to catch or tempt it ; for in catch-
ing Birds, Beasts, or Fishes, such esculents as are properly for these
Animals, are made use of to allure them, neither can mankinde
command them by any threats to come into his custody.

14. How much less is mankind able to compel ^h^ Infernal Spirits, Nothing is
the very least of which Kingdom, is able, if let loose, to exterminate a contraries. ^
thousand lives, and utterly over-turn poor mortals and their doings,

as various by-past accidents can evince : But whosoever hath com-
pacted with them for body, soul, and works, such they are at unity
with, and unto such they appear for the advancement of their Kingdom
in the destruction of others ; for they are grafted into them and
incorporated into their very heart and soul, which unavoidably
becomes their wages when the body falls away.

15. Yet many wayes there be by Images, Telesms, and Amulets,
which have little or no dependance upon Conjuration, or the strength
thereof, being rather effectual from sympathetical Causes, as many
natural conclusions prove. And Paracelsus speaks of a way by the
Image of any Bii'd or Beast to destroy that Animal, though at a
distance ; so by hair, fat, blood, excrements, excrescences, &^c. of any
Animal or Vegetable, the ruin or cure of that thing may be effected.

16. Which is seen in the Armary Unguent, and the Sympathetical

Forms of



Powder. In the instance of divers Histories, of such as used Waxen
Images, composed in divers postures, and under certain Constellations,
whereby several have been tormented and macerated even unto death;
and according to the punishment or torment which the Magician
intends to afflict, accordingly do they dispose the hour of the Composi-
tion, and the posture or semblance of the Image.

17. For if a malitious minded Witch intends to consume and pine
away the Life or Estate of any miserable Man or Woman, she makes
his Image of Wax in such an ominous aspect as may conduce to her
design, making several magical Characters upon the sides of the head,
describing the Character of the hour or Planetary time upon the
breast of the Image ; the name of the party on his forehead ; the
intended effect to be wrought upon him upon his back. When they
cause aches, pains, and violent pangs in the sinews and the flesh, they
stick thorns and pins in divers places of their arms, breasts, and legs.
When they cast them into Feavers and Consumptions, they spend an
hour in every day to warm and turn the Image before a doleful and
lingring fire, composed of divers exotick Gums, and magical Ingre-
dients of sweet Odours, and strange Roots of shrubs, efficient for their
purpose.

18. Wonderful are the various postures and pranks which Magicians
play with Images ; neither will I mention the most perfect and pre-
valent part of the practice of Images, and the powerful operations
thereof, least the evil minded should work abominations therewith
upon the Persons or Possessions of their neighbours.

19. According to the nature of what they would effect they frame
their Images ; if by Images they would provoke two parties to love,
or be enamoured on one another, they frame their Images naked, with
Astrological Observations and Imbraces of those that are Venereal ;
to provoke unto enmity they place malignant Characters and Aspects,
and the Images in a fighting posture.

20. If their intentions be for good, all their Characters are engraven
upon the foreparts of the body. But if they would afflict the party
with Consumption, or with death, they thrust Needles through the
hearts, and engrave their Characters upon their Posteriors, or upon
their shoulders, using all their Conjurations retrograde, and repeating
every Charm opposite to the former.

21. Thousands of strange and uncouth Charms might be here
described, according to the exact form wherein Tradition hath left
them; But I have only insisted upon the description of the natures
in General ; And as by Images and Telesiiis, the Europeans have
effected admirable things : so the Tartars have a wonderful ways* of
producing the like effects, by Botles^ Sheep-skins, Rods, Basins,

in the practice and effect throughout France, Italy, and Spain, as also
in all the Eastern Countries, that the Laws of several Nations have
prohibited the performance thereof ; neither is it fit to be openly
described in this place.

23. Other stratagems they have by turning the Sive with a pair of Charming by
Sizzers by voices jittered out of skins, which is in common amongst the

tedious to be enumerated.

24. The Art of Transplantation is also reckoned amongst Charms Transpiantati-
with the vulgar. And indeed one member thereof, viz. the Trans- nfous"*^'"""
ferring of Diseases is really Magical, and much in practice amongst [t Ceremonies]
Witches ; for by certain baits given to any domestick Beasts they

remove Feavers, Agues, and Consumptions from Martial men, or from
one to another by burying certain Images in their neighbours
ground they bring all evil fortune to the owner of the ground,
yet though they add strange Words and Conjurations in the practice, 72.
the effects thereof are more from Nature then Conjuration.

25. For, by the same Cause, those that are profound, can destroy And meeriy

excrements, &^c. or by any root, or carnuous substance, rubbed upon

their hands, breasts or leggs, by burying which, they free them from
Diseases, which experiments take effect according to the Mediums
and their Consumption under ground.

26. And as by natural reason every Magical Charm or Receipt had Magical In-
its first institution; In like manner have Magicians disposed the ^"■"™«"t* =
Matter and Manner together with the times of their Utensils and
Instruments, according to the Principles of Nature : As the Hour
wherein they compose their Garments, must either be in the hour of

Luna, or else of Saturn, in the Moons increase.

27. Their Garments they compose of White Linnen, black Cloth, Their matter,
black Cat-skins, Wolves, Bears, or Swines skins. The Linnen

Utensils that are put to common uses. The skins of the aforesaid
Animals are by reason of the Saturnine and Magical qualities in the
particles of these beasts : Their sowing thred is of silk, Cats guts,
mans Nerves, Asses hairs. Thongs of skins from Men, Cats, Bats,
Owls, Moles, and all which are enjoyn'd from the like Magical
cause.

28. Their Needles are made of Hedge-hog prickles, or bones of any
of the abovesaid Animals : Their Writing-pens are of Owls or
Ravens, their hik of Mans blood : Their Oyntments Mans fat, Blood,

■ Usnea, Hoggs-grease, Oyl of Whales. Their Characters are ancient
Hebrew or Samaritan : Their Speecli is Hebrew or Latine. Their
Paper mMst be of the Membranes of Infants, which they call Virgin-
-parchment, or of the skins of Cats, or Kids. Besides, they compose
their Fires of sweet Wood, Oyl or Rosin ; And their Candles of the
Fatt or Marrow of Men or Children : Their Vessels are Earthen,
their Candlesticks with three feet, of dead mens bones : Their Szvords
are steel, without guards, the poynts being reversed. These are
their Materials, which they do particularly choose from the Magical
qualities whereof they are composed.

29. Neither are the peculiar shapes without a natural cause. Their
Caps are Oval, or like Pyramids with Lappets on each side, and furr
within : Their Gowtis reach to the ground, being furr'd with white
Fox-skins, under which they have a Linnen Garment reaching to their
Knee. Their Girdles are three inches broad, and have many Cabal-
listical Names, with Crosses, Trines and Circles inscribed thereon.
Their Knives are Dagger-fashion : and the Circles by which they
defend themselves are commonly nine foot in breadth, but the Eastern
Magicians give but seven. And these are the matter and manner of
their Preparations, which I thought fit here to insist upon, because of
their affinity with the Instrunieiits of Charms, for both which a
natural cause is constantly pretended.

30. Thus I have briefly spoken of the Nature of every Spirit good
or evil, so farr as safety or convenietice would permit ; adding also
this last Discourse of Charms and Conjurations, in their speculative
part, forbearing to describe the Forms themselves, because many of
them are not only facil, but also of mighty power when they are
seasonably applyed : So that to describe distinctly, by what means
Magicians kill, cure, or conquer, were to strengthen the hands of the
Envious against their Neighbours Lives and Fortunes. And there-
fore the Readers must rest contented with what is here related of the
Nature of Astral or Infernal Spirits.



FINIS.



SHAKESPEARE NOTINGS.



p. 99. Bodin's "asseheaded man". N. Drake, in his Shakespeare
and his Times, vol. ii, p. 351, suggested that Bottom's "translation"
was derived from p. 315 in Scot, where a receipt for such transforma-
tions is given. This may in part have been in Shakespeare's memory,
as may tlie commonly received belief that magicians could do such
things. He may, too, have remembered another tale, told at p. 533,
of Pope Benedict IX having been condemned after death to walk
the earth (I presume at night, after his purgatorial day) in a bear's
skin, with an ass's head in such sort as he lived. But I incline to
think that these after-statements only caused him to remember the
more this first, full, and remarkable M. Mal-Bodin-Cyprus tale ; and
more especially this passage, for in iv, i, 30, Bottom declares — -
" Methinks I have a great desire to a bottle of hay : good liay, sweet
hay hath no fellow." So acute and ready an observer may have the
more remembered the epithet "asseheaded" because, as most readers
must observe, Scot uses this word, though the sailor in the tale is an
ass from his snout and ears down to the end of his tail and the tips
of his hoofs.

P. 542. His "white spirits". Because in the 1623 folio Macbeth
we have in iv, i, Miisicke and a Song. Blackc Spirits, ^^c, and
because in Middleton's Witch the words are given at length, it has
been held that Middleton was either Shakespeare's coadjutor, or his
after interpolator, that these lines were his, and were first used in his
IVitch. But, according to most of Malone's arguments — for one
certainly is not sound — the Witch was some years later than Macbeth,
as is also likely from Middleton's age. And that it was later is in
especial shown by a hitherto unnoticed passage in ii, i :

" Some knights' wives in town
Will have great hope upon his reformation," etc.

For it is clear that this must have been written when the price and
quality of knighthood had much come down, and its commonness
increased beyond what it was in 1605. Secondly, it is an assumption,
and a most unlikely one, that the Macbeth MS. intimation of the song
was due to the players' knowledge of it through the Witch. It pre-
supposes that the supernumeraries who played the witches' parts were
the same in both plays. Also that the writers of the MS- knew that
these would be the same, and would certainly remember the words:
for a playhouse copy is either for the use of the prompter, or a text
whence the players' parts can be extracted. Moreover, the li^itch



544 Shakespeare N^o tings.

had been, as the author himself tells us, " an ignorantly ill-fated
labour", in other words, a failure.

But in reference to the supposed right of Middleton to these lines,
we now find, in 1584, when Middleton was a boy, that the first of the
two lines — or, if one chooses, the first two of the four, the words being
in each half phrase inverted, possibly to vary the too great sing-song
of the sentence — was copied by Scot as part of a known series of
rhyming lines. Shakespeare, who wrote later, has the "Black spirits",
etc.; Middleton, in his Witch., where we find passages taken ver-
batim and almost verbatim from Scot, has these and the other rhymes
given by Scot very slightly altered in i, 2, and the " Black spirits",
etc., with " Mingle, mmgle", and some of the other rhymes in v, 2.
Hence they are neither Shakespeare's nor Middleton's. Whose then are
they.-" Scot gives them as from W. W.'s booklet on the Witches at
St. Osees, Essex. But certainly the lines, nor any of them, are not
in that booklet. These things, however, are there. Ursula Kempe's
little boy deposes, and she herself, on promise from the Justice,
Brian Darcie, Esq., of favour being shown her — which promise, by
the way, both in her case and that of others, was carried out by their
being hanged — that she had two he- and two she-spirits, the shes
being Tyffen, in the shape of a white lamb, and Pigine, black like a
toad ; the hes, Tittie, like a little grey cat, and Jacke, black like a cat.
Nor are these merely thus mentioned by each, but the old woman
specifies their doings through three or four of the earlier pages
(A 3, v — A 8). Mother Bennet's spirits were two, Suckin, like a black
dog, and Lyerd, redde like a Lyon (B 3, etc., B 7). Besides these, but
less prominently brought forward, were these. Mother Hunt had
two little things like horses, one white and one black, kept in a pot
amongst black and white wool (A 5, v and 6). Ales Hunt had also
two spirits, one white and one black, like little colts, and named Jacke
and Robbin (C 3). Marg. Sammon had a Tom and a Robyn, but
these were like toads. H. Sellys, aged nine, deposes that his mother
had two imps, one Herculus sothe hons \sic\ or Jacke, black, and a he,
who, in the night, and in the likeness of his sister, pulled his younger
brother's leg and otherwise hurt him so that he cried out ; the second,
Mercuric, a she and white (D v). Ales Baxter says that the cow
while being milked was viciously unruly, and that something like a
white cat struck at her heart, so that she became so weak that she could
not stand, and being found leaning against a style, was carried home
in a chair (D 4, v). Ales Mansfield had given her by margaret
Grevell (elsewhere Gravell) — for these imps seem to have been given
away without will of their own, like brute beasts, and being hungry
were fed on milk, beer, bread, oats, hay, straw, and especially a sup
of blood sucked from the body — two he- and two she-spirits, named
Robin, Jack, William, and Puppet, alias Mamet, like black cats (D 6).
Mother Eustace also had three imps, like white, gray, and black cats.
Annis Dowsing, aged seven, base daughter of Annis Herd, tells B.
Darcie that her mother had six Avices or Blackbirds, black speckled
with white or all black. Also six imps like cows, but " as big as
rattes", one of which, black and white, and named Crowe, had been



Shakespeare No tings. 545

given to her, while Donne [? Dun], another, was red and white (G. 4.
v). I have, perhaps, overlengthened this tale through wishing to
show that these imps, besides being hungry, generally took a white
or black, and sometimes a red or grey, colour, and because these
notings from this unique book and authentic record might be other-
wise acceptable. So much do the names and the notice of the colours
of the imps strike a reader, that Bishop Hutchinson, in his Historical
Essay concerning Witchcraft, 1718, says, p. 29, "An account of them
was written by Brian Darcie, with the Names and Colours of their
spirits." But here an end after the remarks. First, that the chief
witnesses, and leaders up to these confessions, were their own children
of from 6^( to g years of age. Secondly, that these confessions were,
as plainly as possible, first made by some and then followed by others
through promises of favour, promises lyingly carried out to condemn-
ation and death. Thirdly, that, as shown by such instances as "[she]
desired to speake alone with me, the said Bryan Darcey, whereupon
I went into my garden", etc., and by the frequent use of " before
mee'' — the initials W.W. were either fictitious, or not improbably those
of his clerk, and that the real author was Brian Darcie, Esq., Justice
of the Peace, who desired to gain favour from his kinsman. Lord
Darcie, to whom the book was dedicated, or possibly, through him
and it, the notice of her Majesty, as a clever, zealous, and trustworthy
seeker-out of these old-new things.

It need hardly be added that ballading was then a profession, and
that its professors seized upon anything of interest, — an atrocious
murder, the last words of the murderer (spoken or not), unusual
floods or storms, the effects of lightning, the cruise of an adventurous
vessel, shipwrecks, the story of a strange fish "in forme of a woman
from the wast upward", that appeared " forty thousand fathom above
water [or otherwise], and sang as followeth". How then should the
condemnation of some sixteen old women for horrible crimes escape
being "balletted"? It was new, rare, came home to all, and was in
more senses than one deadly. The very rhymes in Scot prove it, for
they could not be Scot's own words, and they have the very rhythm,
or rather lilt, of a ballad. On looking calmly, therefore, at the evi-
dence, I am convinced that neither Shakespeare nor Middleton could
have been the one who tacked together these rhymes between 1 582 and
1584. but that Shakespeare did here, as he sometimes did, and notably
in Ophelia's madness, quote such lines as " Black spirits and white",
etc., because the words suited his scene of devilish enchantment,
and gave it reality; while Middleton, in a Magical Tragi-Comedy, gave,
with very slight variation, the whole of the words quoted by Scot.

I trust my reader will not merely excuse it when it regards Shake-
speare and Macteth, if I go a little out of my present road and add
the few words following. As it has been held that Middleton wrote
" Black spirits", etc., so it has been supposed that the lines on the
" Touching for the Evil" were interpolated by Middleton or some
other, because negative evidence seemed to show that James did not
take upon himself this custom till a date much later than 1605.
Lately, however. Prof S. R. Gardiner has discovered that James

4A

" touched" and was almost compelled to "touch" as early as 1603.
Its efficacy had been believed in, and was set forth in books ; so that
the very assumption of this prerogative proved its efficacy, and thus
proved his rightful heirship to the English crown, — a proof, I suspect,
not lost sight of by the astute counsellors who counselled its adoption,
nor by James himself And I think that he must be blind who
cannot see how this, added to the other evidence set forth in the play,
and to the true, though somewhat, and of purpose, indirectly exposed
intent of Macbeth, proved both James's heirship and set forth the
certain overthrow of all such devilishly contrived plots,— such as, to
name but three, the attempt at the Carse of Gowrie; the plot in which
Raleigh was, or was supposed to be, concerned ; and lastly, the gun-
powder plot — as would alter the predestinate decree of Heaven, that
James I and VI should be King of Great Britain. Unless, too, I
am much mistaken, the fears of James were the direct or indirect
instigators of Shakespeare's play, and the cause of that autograph
letter to the poet, for which no shadow of a reason can otherwise be
assigned.

For convenience' sake I here include some notings illustrative of
either Shakespeare's indebtedness to Scot, or of those beliefs and
forms of expression which led both to write as they did.

P. 10. " They can pull down the moon." This belief, derived from
classic times, is authority for Prospero's " A witch ... so strong
That could control the moon" (v, i). So also ii, i, 174.

" Corne in the blade." There is frequent reference to this

in Scot, as here and at pp. A iiii, v, 49, 58, 63,219,221,482, and else-
where. But as Staunton saw, this is the nearest to IMacbetlis
"though bladed corn be lodged" (iv, i). Also, though this happens
more or less in several of the instances, yet especially here, the con-
text agrees with the thoughts and context-words of Macbeth.

P. 33. "Anthropophagi and Canibals." Associated synonymes pro-
bably suggested to both by the same heading in p. iioo of Seb.
Miinster's CosmograpJiy (Basil, 1550).

P. 42. " Never faile to danse." An authority for the dancing of
Macbeth^s witches, and a probable authority for the dancing of
the latter with broomsticks headed with brooms in their hands.

P. 54. The " Monarcho" of L. L. Lost appears from this to have
been a madman.

P. 64. " Rime either man or beast to death." An extension of the
Shakespearean and general belief that they rhymed (Irish) rats to
death. As You Like It, iii, 2.

P. TT. " No power to occupy." Proof that this last word was used in
the sense of to use or be busied with, from which general use it came
to be employed as common slang for a disreputable and vile using.

P. 170. " Chattering of pies and haggisters." A haggister is the
Kentish term for a pie, or magpie. The passage explains why
Duncan (i, 5) is not welcomed by these, but by the ill-omened raven
that is hoarse with croaking his approach. W. Perkins on Witchcraft,
works, ed. 1613, says : "When a raven stands on a high place and
looks a particular way and cries, a corse comes thence soon."



Shakespeare No tings. 547

p. 187. "A thousand for one that fell out contrary." We would
more correctly write — " A thousand that fell out contrary for one that
fell out rightly or correctly." But this and others are examples of
what we would call a more than loose way of expressing oneself,
though then it was allowable, for Scot was an educated and intelli-
gent man, who wrote well. " Each putter out of five for one",
Tempest^ iii, 2, is an almost exactly similar instance. The putting out
of five for one is considered as one action, and is — pace Dyce — the
receiving, as Malone says, at the rate of five for one, the putter out
being he who puts out in the hope of receiving five for one.

P. 212. " The blind man ... in killing the crow." Green's De-
fence of Cony-Catching, p. 70, ed. Grosart, gives this proverbial
saying — "as blinde men shoote the crowe". Hamlet, 4to., 1603, has
the variant — "as the blinde man catcheth the hare".

"A green silk curtain." These words, also in Middleton's Witch,
i, 2, illustrate the custom which led Sir Toby {Tw. N., i, 4) to say,
"Wherefore have these gifts a curtain before 'em.'' Are they like to
take dust like Mistress AIoU's picture?" And these last words, by the
way, prove that this same Moll had, for her own purposes, the portrait
exposed in some painter's shop, or painters' shops, or rather free
fronts, without a curtain.

P. 269. " If a soule wander ... by night." Proof that the wan-
dering of Hamlet's father's ghost was strictly in accordance with
traditional folk-lore. So, p. 462, we have, " How common an opinion
. . . reveale their estate"; and p. 535, "They affirme . . . soules of
saints".

P. 347. "Bodkin." The text and margin show that this was used for
a small dagger, and the woodcut on the next page that it was some-
times at least a rod-like and pointed weapon. Being thus shaped it
was small, more easily carried at the waist, and less readily broken
either by a bone or by an adversary's stroke.

P. 382. '•^Belial." This goes to show that he was " the other devil"
whose name had escaped Macbeth's porter. Its being less common
in men's and preachers' mouths would account for his non-remem-
brance.

P. 416. "■Lignum aloes.'''' Against any argument drawn from the
italic use of Hews in Son. 20, and its not being italicised in its first
use in the same line, nor anywhere else in Shakespeare, the fact
that Allocs appears in The Lover's Complaint, as well as do other
words in the Sonnets, has been brought forward. But without
entering in detail into the question, I would note that three sub-
stantives, all names of vegetables, are here mentioned, and that this
alone is placed in italics. So, in the Appendix II, 1665, pp. 67-8, we
have a number of aromatics named, but this only, and only on its
second occurrence, is with Sperma Ceti placed in italics — the reason,
I presume, being, that as a medicine, a more strange and less-known
name to the commonalty, and a Latin one, it was treated as a quoted
proper name.

P. 497. " He burned his booke." A precedent, as was Acts ix, 19,
for Prospero's " I'll drown my book", when he left his island.



54^ Shakespeare Notings.

P. 498. "Bicause they want." One example, among many, from
Elizabethan and present authors, and from provincial use, where
want =^ "be", or "are without". This in part explams Macbeth., iii,
6, where Lennox exclaims, "Who cannot want the thought?" The
true difficulty lies in the use of the negative "cannot". But while a
more correct style would have " can", the more colloquial and hasty
use of the former was, I think, permissible, just as was the use of the
double negative where it was not meant to be, as it usually was,
emphatic. Moreover, it gives here a double or ambiguous sense,
such as, I think, Lennox wanted to express.

P. 504. " One instant or pricke of time." Illustrates somewhat
differently than I think is usually explained, " the prick of noon". R.
and J til.., and other places.

P. 516. "Diverse shapes and forms." Shakespeare follows this
ruling when he makes Ariel and his co-spirits assume different shapes,
though some modern critics find fault because he being on some
occasions invisible, these changes are, in their opinion, unnecessary.
But the appearance of these spirits, sometimes as invisible, sometimes
as visible, sometimes in spirit form, sometimes as Juno or Ceres,
sometimes as harpies, is not only in accordance with the then beliefs
as to airy spirits, but to me, and to those who have seen their repre-
sentatives, it is more pleasant to see them in forms appropriate to
their office, besides bringing their spiritual existence and power more
vividly before us. Critics here, as well as elsewhere, too often insist
on considering Shakespeare as the author of books to be read, and
not of plays to be acted and seen.

P. 518. " This devil Beelzebub." So seems to have thought Mac-
beth' s porter.

P. 520. " The cruell angel." Here in Prov. 17 [11] we have one of
the principles on which Macbeth was planned and executed.

P. 533. " Soules appeare oftenest by night; . . . never to the whole
multitude, also may be scene of some[,] and of some other in that
presence not scene at all." Here is proof of the folk-lore correctness
of the ghost appearing only when Marcellus and Bernardo were alone
on watch, and of his being afterwards invisible to the Queen in her
own chamber, though visible to Hamlet while there in obedience to
her summons.

Appendix II, p. 46, par. 8. ^^Bnt it is rarely kftown." Though this
is after Shakespeare's time, the belief, in all probability, was in exist-
ence in his day, and shows how the writer of the first and unknown
Hamlet followed in Hajiilefs ghost the beliefs of his day.

'"'' Feature.'''' An example of its being used for the make of a man,
and not merely of the features of his countenance, to which it is now
appropriated ; but till I can find- — and as yet I have found none,
though I have looked out for it — an example of feature used for things
inanimate, I cannot accept the interpretation of song or sonnet m
Touchstone's As Yoii Like It., iii, 3, 3. Feature here, as any shape or
proportions, is perfectly intelligible. Did it refer to verse we should
expect "features". From no man, as Touchstone is depicted by Shake-



Shakespeare Notings. 549

speare, could we less expect verse-making, and all his reference to it
in this passage may readily have arisen from his reference to his new
situation as like that of the ho7iest poet Ovid among the Goths. Had
he been poetical and given her verses, he could not have explained
to Aubrey that he, being a poet, only feigned to love her.

P. 198. '■'■ Primus sccundusP This goes far to show — proves, I
think — that the Clown's " Prime, secundo, tertio is a good play" {Tw.
N., V, i), a passage on which no commentator known to me has
touched, thinking it a merely jocular remark, is, in fact, taken from a
well-known "play" or game. What the game was is unknown to me,
but children still use various numerals, provincial or otherwise,
mingled with rhyme, to settle anything, as, for instance, who shall
hide in the game of hide and seek.

P. 471. "Biggins." Shows, as does 2 Hy. IV, iv, 5, 27, that, if not
nightcaps, they meant, among other significations, caps worn at night
and in bed, and that " homely" was not a generic epithet.

Introd. Rainolde Scot's Will " bank or pond". I note this because
it may possibly help to some future interpretation of Iris's words in
the Tempest, iv, i, 64, "The banks with pioned . . . brims."




MIDDLETON'S "WITCH".



p. 117. " MarwaritM', etc. In i, 2, he copies these names, alter-
ing only their order for the sake of the verse, and probably for the
same reason omitting " Mevais".

"I could give thee
Chirocinata, adincantida,
Archimedon, marmaritin, calicia,
Which I could sort to villainous barren ends."

P. 124. " Needles wherwith dead bodies are sowne or sockt into
their sheetes." [Noted amidst charms procuring love and hate.] In
i, 2, following the marmaritin passage, we find —

" More I could instance
As, the same needles thrust into their pillows
That sews and socks up dead men in their sheets. "

This is the more noteworthy, as to sock a corpse seems to have been
a Kentish phrase. " A privy gristle", etc., as given by Middleton, was,
I presume, one of the other things which, "for reverence of the reader",
Scot omits, though whence the former got it I know not.

Among other " toies which procure love" are, " a little fish

called Remora". In the same scene of the Witch, we find —

^* Here. Thou com'st for a love charm now

I'll give thee a remora, shall bewitch her straight.
******

a small fish."

Scot also gives " the bone of a greene frog, the flesh thereof

being consumed with pismers or ants". And Middleton's Hecate
adds —

" The bones of a green frog too, wondrous precious,
The flesh consum'd by pismires."

" The haire growing on the nethermost part of a woolves

taile . . . the braine of acat." In ii, 2, Almachildes, speaking of love
charms, says : " The whorsom old hellcat would have given me the
brain of a cat . . . and a little bone in the hithermost part of a wolf's
tail." In the words " bone" and " hithermost" he may have erred in
memory, or there may in the latter word have been a copyist's error.

P. 153. Hecate, i, 2, enumerates " Urchins, Elves, Hags, [fairies]



Middletoiis ''Witch'\ 551

Satyrs, Pans, Fauns, Sylvans, Kitt-with-the-candlestick, Tritons,

Centaurs, Dwarfs [giants], Imps [ ], the Spoo[r]n, the Mare,

the Man-i-the-oak, the Hellwaine, the Fire-drake, the Puckle ! "
[....]. These, except the omissions marked by ... . and by [ ],
are exactly those mentioned by Scot, and in the same order.

P. 184. Scot, from J. B. Porta. Neap., gives a receipt to be used by
witches when they would transport themselves through the air. " \\
The fat of yoong children and seethe it [etc., etc.] . . . They put there,
into Eleoselinum, Aconitum, Frondes populeasand Soote . . . Another
receipt . . . R, Slum, acarum vulgare, pentaphyllon, the bloud of a
flittermouse, solanum somniferum, & oleum."

In i, 2, we have these bits almost verbatim —

" Hec. There take this unbaptised brat,
Boil it well ; preserve the fat :
You know 'tis precious to transfer
Our 'nointed flesh into the air
In moonlight nights,

I thrust in eleoselinum lately,
Aconitum, frondes populeas and soot —

* * * *

Then slum, acorum vulgare too,
Pentaphyllon, the blood of a flitter-mouse
Solanum somnxjlcum et oleum."

" By this means (saith he) in a moonlight night [see fifth

line of i, 2, just quoted] they seeme to be carried through the air, to
feasting, singing, dansing, kissing, colling, and other acts of venerie,
with such youthes as they love and desire most." In i, 2, just after the
previous lines, are these —

" When hundred leagues in the air, we feast and sing,
Dance, kiss, and coll, use everything :
What young man can we wish to pleasure us.
But we enjoy him in an incubus."

P. 186. "frier Bartholomseus " [Spinaeus] saith that . . . "the
witches before they annoint themselves do heare in the night time a
great noise [^band or troop] of minstrels, which flie over them, with
the ladie of the fairies, and ... to their journie." In iii, i, Firestone
says ..." Hark, hark, mother, they are over the steeple already, flying
over your head with a noise of musicians."

P. 222. " It is constantlie affirmed in AI. Mai. that Staftis . . .
had a disciple called Hoppo, who made Stadlin a maister witch, and
could all when they list, invisiblie transferre the third part of their
neighbors doong, hay, corne, &c : into their own ground, make haile,
tempests, and flouds, with thunder and lightning." Bodin also, bk. ii,
c. 6 ; but he makes Hoppo and Stadlin co-disciples of Stafus and
master witches. Compare i, 2, ad init. for Hoppo and Stadlin, while
further on comes —



552 Middletons "Witci\

" Stadlin's within :
She raises all your sudden ruinous storms
That shipwreck barks, and tear up growmg oaks.
*****

I'll call forth Hoppo, and her incantation
Can straight destroy the young of all his cattle ;
Blast vineyards, orchards, meadows ; or in one night
Transport his dung, hay, corn, by reeks, whole stacks.
Into thine own ground."

P. 244. "A ab hur husy A charm against the toothache. Hence it
is most probable, especially if the ! of " Puckle !" be in the original,
that Hecate, after reaching that name, is interrupted by a sudden
spasm of toothache, which she would exorcise by this "yi ab hur ]iiis'\
The sudden pause, the contortions of her haggard visage, and the
grotesque movements of the 1 17-year-old hag would greatly add to the
comedy of the scene.

P. 542. When this mortal witch Hecate — not the Queen of Hell and
of Witchdom, as was the Hecate of antiquity and of Shakespeare, and
others in the middle ages, for, says one of the after writers given in
the later editions of M. Mai, " Hecate artem magicam doceret" — uses
in i, 2, the very rhymes spoken of under this page in the Shakespeare
writings, some [ands] and [&c., his] being omitted, and "devil-lambe"
being changed to "devil-ram". In v, 2, she again mentions " Titty
and Tififin, Leaid and Robin", and thistime " Pucky", for the rhyme's
sake. Hellwin and Prickle are — as shown by her other mention of
them (see note, p. 153), as well as her mention of them elsewhere —
mere copyists' or printers' errors for Hellwain and Puckle.

P. 222. One would here add the quotation from Ovid's Metani. made
by Hecate, the first line running in Scott, Middleton, Corn. Agrippa
{Ocailt Phil., 1. I, c. 72), and in Bodin, Damono, 1. 2, c. 2 : " Cum
volui . . . ipsis mirantibus" instead of "Quorum ope cum . . . miran-
tibus"; but that from the accidental dropping of the line " Vivaque
saxa", etc., in Bodin, and its omission also in Middleton, it would seem,
as Dyce remarks, that Middleton took it from Bodin. In conclud-
ing, I would state that most, but not all, of these references are taken
from Dyce's Middleton.



EXTRACTS FROM WIER.



I.

Besides those noted by Scot in the margins, I have gathered the
following from Wier, though very possibly some may have been over-
looked. By far the greater number occur in the 12th Book of Scot;
that is, they consist chiefly of various charms and illustrative tales.

I would not be understood, however, as thinking that Scot in all
these cases copied from Wier, any more than I would assert that some
later Astronomer Royal has quoted from Herschel, without mention-
ing him, the fact "that the earth revolves around the sun". The
reference in both to the Homerica viedicatio from Ferrerius (in Scot,
Ferrarius) is a notable one in point, and two other instances will be
found in Notes on the Text. I quite agree, also, with Prof. W.
T. Gairdner when he says, Insanity, p. 61 : " Nothing, however, is
more evident than that Scot, however indebted to "Wier (and both
of them probably to Cornelius Agrippa . . . ), was far in advance of
either in the clearness of his views and the unwavering steadiness of
his leanings to the side of humanity and justice."

N.B. — "&c." for the words following in the page has been omitted,
as unnecessary.

P. 7. The reader may compare the first, and the first part of par. 2
of ch. 3 with Wier, De Laniits, c. 5, " Quocirca eam", etc., and judge
whether the remembrance of this latter did not suggest Scot's words.

P. 53. " One Bt'ssus.'" From Plutarch. Also given by Wier ; but
I have lost the reference.

P. III. '■'■ Chasaphr Scot seems to have remembered Wierii, i, § 2,
but not to have copied him. Wier gives Exod. 22, 18. ov Trepifii-vaaTc'^
Scot, ovK eTTi^ewaeTe, a variant I know not whence obtained, not being
in the Oxford 1821 ed. of the Sept.

P. 123. '■'• Eusebitis . . . poison." Wier iii, 38, § 2 and 4. Both call
Lucilia Lucilla. Scot omits § 3 regarding Alphonso of Arragon.

P. 126. " This word Ob . . . VentriloqitiP Wier ii, i, § 12.

P. 177. " Onen ... to the interpretation of dreames." Wier ii, i,
§ 8, " aliquando observara somnia."

P. 183. "The art . . . in digging for monie [ . . • omit]. There must
. . .treasure awaie." Wier v, 11, [§ i. Scot adds "bona" after
" videre".

P. 184. "RThe fat . . . impudentlie affirmed them" [close of ch.].
Wier iii, 17, § 2, 3. But from the first and last words of Scot's chapter,
he, as well as Wier, took these things from J. B. Porta, though he
may have been led by Wier to consult Porta.

4B



554 Extracts from Wier.

p. 230. ^'' Balsainisy Scot's words at the beginning of the chapter
were suggested by Wier v, 9, § 4, though he has added some descrip-
tive particulars ; then these words are given by both, Wier adding
that three Agnus Dei's were sent by Pope Urban.

P. 231. "^ ivastcote of proof eP Wier v, 8, § 2. Scot's "httle virgine
girl" is a " junioribus nota; castitatis puelles", his " hat" is " galea".

'•'•Caspar." These verses, with a longer proem, are in Wier v,

8§i.

P. 240. " Homerica niedicatio." Wier v, 19, § i. See note in its
place. Wier quotes at length from Ferrarius, § 2, 3, and 4, gives his
name rightly, and rightly reads in the present passage verbis., and
not as Scot, verbi.

'■'• Nos habitats Wier v, 19, § 3, from Ferrarius.

P. 242. " For the falling evil ... no more." Wier v, 8, § 2 ; but he
finishes the charm with " In nomine [etc.]. Amen."

P. 243. '•'• Ananizapta^\ v, 9, § 6. Wier gives Anantsapta, has "quse"
instead of "dum", 1. i, and adds " contra febres a quodam nebulone
. . . offerantur".

" Write upon a piece of bread" [for the bite of a mad dog].

This Scot gives from v, 8, § 6. But Wier has ". . . Khiriori essera
. . . fede". Afterwards, " Vel hoc scriptum in papiro, aut pane, homini
sive cani in os inseritur". In the O rex, etc., there are crosses after
each person of the Trinity, and a " prax" after Caspar, while " I max"
is " ymax".

P. 244. "Against the toothache.'' "Galbes, etc. . . . persanateP
These two charms, omitting the intervening one, are in Wier v, 8, § 6,
adding to \.ht fersanate one, " hoc scriptum appenditur". The second,
" At saccaring", etc., is given v, 4, § 2.

" Let a virgine", v, 8, § 3. Wier preceding this with the words,

" Ita anticjuitas credebat, verbascum cum sua radice tusum, vino asper-
sum, folioque involutum, & in cinere calefactum, strumisque im-
positum, eas abigere, si hoc fecisset virgo jejuna jejuno, & manu
tangens supino dixisset."

P. 246. "A gentlewoman'', v, 18, § i. But the charm is a versification,
probably by Scot himself, of a German prose sentence, and it was
given and the story told "a viro Ecclesiastico, non infimi nominis
Theologo". Scot evidently thought that this description of the per-
petrator of so indecorous a jest might better be omitted, even though
he were a German.

" To open locks .... Take a peece . . . Anen''\ v, 1 1, § 2 ;

but " hinder" is anteriore. The essential part of the words just marked
as omitted is in v, 11, § 3.

"^ char jne to drive . . . louse." This and the marginal note

are in v, 14, § 4. But Wier places " vel" between each of the Bible
sentences, therefore Scot's " this sentence" should have been " any of
these sentences".

P. 247. " Another for the same'\ v, 14, § 2, beginning " Item".
Scot has shortened his "fiftlie", and omitted that the beggar must pray
with all attention. Also in his haste he omits that the conjuror gave
doses of rhubarb and other herbs twice daily.



Extracts from Wier. 555

p. 247. " The sicke man", v, 23, § 6. Wier gives the words of the
" gospell" that is to be carried about his neck — " Hoc genus da;monii
non ejicitur, nisi jejunio & oratione" — taken, though apparently by
memory only, from Matt. 17, 20, Vulg. The names in Scot's margin
are in Wier, Gualterio, Bernhardo.

Pp. 247-8. " This office or conjuration." The paragraph is from v,
22, § 6, with a slight condensation of the first words.

pi 248. "y4 citarinefor the dots'", v, 4, § 8. Scot only omitting the
" sanctus" before " Job".

P. 249. " There are also", v, 4, § 7. Wier commences — " Vidi, haud
ita pridem apud magna; authoritatis virum nobilem, librum conscrip-
tum execrabilem, flammis dignissimum, plenum exorcismis, frequenti
crucis consignatione, & ex sancta Scriptura formulis in nomine
Patris [etc.] finitis, contra equorum non modo morbos quoslibet," etc.
But he has not " as it . . . Rome."

" Item, the Duke of Alba", v, 4, § 5. " Equo item Vice-regis

in sacello suum fuisse locum ubi celebraretur Missa. Continebat Sc
dux exercitus vexillum in manu, quamdiu sollennibus ritibus idipsum
uti campana; solent, baptizaretur. Ornabat & hunc actum effigies D.
Virginis Maria; cum filiolo in eodem volans, & duse complicatas
manus ad stipulantium morem."

"That wine", v, 4, § 9. Scot omitting after eager, "eo

anno".

P. 252. "J^jzf^w^j- pigeon", i, 19, § 3, 4. Scot omitting all notice of
the apostate confederate Sergius, of the trained bull, and of the words
before rex esto, viz., " Ouicunque tauro jugum imponat".

P. 253, "At Memphis in Aegypt", i, 19, § i, faithfully yet freely.

P. 254. "I conjure thee O serpent . . . unto the Jewes", v, 4, § 10.
But Wier has no "otherwise", nor any signs of the whole being two
conjurations. After Jewes he has, "te vermem a me discedere oportet,
velut a Judteis discessit Deus noster". His magical words are " Eli lass
eiter, . . . eitter, . . . eitter". Scot's second "I conjure" is "exor-
ciso", and for fear of error, W^ier's " Divam Mariam" becomes " S.
Mary".

P. 257. "A charme . . . with images of wax . . . afterwards in
another." P. 258, 1. i, is in Wier v, 1 1, § 6, 7, 8, except that " And if they
were inserted", etc., is Scot's. The charm words in Wier are "Alif
cafiel zaza . . ." adding "leviatan leutatace". Scot also gives a sentence
which perplexed me till I turned to Wier, "& ferrum, quo homo necatus
fuit, traditur alteri imagini, [of wax] ut alterius necandi simulachri
caput transigat". Also, after " angell must be mentioned", Wier
adds, " Non absimile monstrum fingitur, ut quis tibi in omnibus
obsequatur".

P. 259. '•'• Iinpnribtis . . . breake a bone of him", v, 12, § i. I doubt,
however, Scot's dividing "esus aiiteni^' [etc.] from "You shall not''
[etc.] by the last " otherwise", for Wier does not, and in § 3 tells
of one who silently submitted to all tortures, and on whom was found
— "subscruffiam inter crines quandam parvam schedulam", containing
"►f Jesus autem transiens ►J* per mediam illorum ^ os non commi-
nueris ex eo 4*"-

p. 260. " Charmes to . . . theefe''\ to end of second paragraph, ex-
cept from "even as plainlie" to "confutation hereof, will be found in
V, 5, § I, 2. But there are some additions in Wier (it may be from
Cardan) which I leave to the student reader to look up.

P. 261. ^'A?ioiher waie . . . thcefe"^ v, 5, § 6. Wier adds, " ex sacri-
fici libro clam a me subtracta". Scot's "sea side" is " fluentem
aquam", the " forme of conjuration" is " per Christi passionem,
mortem, & resurrectionem (quam propter impie curiosus celo)".

P. 262. '■'•To put out the thceves eie', v, 5, § 7. "A coopers hammar,
or addes", is " malleo cypressimo".

P. 263. ^'Saitt Adeberts cursse" to "« morte szttnus", Wier, v, 6, § i.
Scot, evidently by accident, omits after made orphanes : " sint male-
dicti in civitate", and by a press or other error the "(Sr* odio habeantur",
etc., becomes "or hated of alL men living", a change slightly injuring
the sense. I know not whether it be due to the more frequent repe-
tition of maledicti in the Latin, but this curse reads to me more
horrible in the original than when translated. I would also note that
here, as sometimes elsewhere, Wier speaks more, and more strongly,
against some of these things than does Scot.

P. 266. " They naile a wolves head", v, 20, § 3,

P. 267. '■'■Terque", given in Wier, v, 21, § i,

'•'■ Adveniat", v, 21, § 6.

'"'■ Baccare", v, 21, § 4.

P. 269. " To spoile a theefe^\ v, 5, § 8. But the strange words are in
Wier, "Droch, myrroch esenaroth", and in the next set of unintelligible
words "ifj-^w 4*" is "H^eson" and "o^V is "ege". He also explains
more clearly, 1 think, that all these conjuring terms are to be thrice
repeated.

P. 270. " Say three severall times", v, 4, § 6, the final Amen and
some 4*5 being omitted.

" Charmes agamst a quotidia7i'\ v, 8, § 7. With these

differences, the three pieces, "the jejunus", should "easdem tribus
diebus edat". Instead of Scot's " Otherwises'' we have " Si minus suc-
cesserit, in pane missali scribitur : O febrem omni laude colendam :
in altero, ... in tertio ... Si nee hie modus juverit, denuo in pane
dicto toties pingatur : . . . quem diebus, ut supra, mane absumat."
Whence it would seem that three massecakes were in each instance
to be used, and not one divided into three, a thought probably sug-
gested by the three pieces of apple.

"For . . . agues intermittent^ The whole paragraph is in v,

8, §7.

P. 271. "6". Barnard', Wier i, 16, § 6.

" Take three consecrated . . . Trinitie", v, 4, § 2, " Recipe

P. 272. " In the yeere." This paragraph is, with a little freeness of
translation and a slight addition, both in the unimportant parts, from
V, 4, § 5-

P. 273. " Take a cup of cold water." This paragraph is from v, 4, § 3.
Scot's Jirglish verses are thus in Wier : " 4* In sanguine Adas orta
est mors : *^ in sanguine Christi redempta est mors : >^ in eodem



Extracts from Wier. 557

sanguine Christi prascipio tibi ►!< 6 sanguis, ut fluxum tuum cohibeas".
Wier then goes to "Aliud: De latere ejus" [etc.], and continues:
"Item (Otherwise) ex quacunque corporis parte profluentum sanguinem
cohibere nituntur his verbis : Christus natus est in Bethlehem" [etc.] ;
and then, without any AHud, Item, or other sign that it is not a con-
tinuation of the same charm, " Tene innominatum digitum in vulnere,
& fac cum eo" [etc.]; Scot's "five wounds" being "sanctorum quinque
vulnerum".

P. 273. "There was a joUie fellowe" to "This dooth Joh : Wierus",
etc., is from v, 15, § i. Wier begins, "Ad insignis malitiae chirurgum",
but Scot's " joUie" seems to have been taiven from his drinking habits,
which in Wier are spoken of in a more pronounced manner.

P. 275. " This surgion", v, 15, § 2. But Scot's " ague" is in Wier
" febrem", and it is added that not long afterwards the patient died, in
his (Wier's) opinion of an empyema. 1 marvel that Scot omitted this
last.

P. 276. " Otherwise: Jesus Christ", v, 15, § 3. Scot omits the ^ after
the first Christ.

"Another such cousening", v, 15, § 4.

P. 282. "At Easter", v, 40, § 4. Note, in the margin I have placed
[.'' or] for the "on" of text. The " .?" is unnecessary, for in Wier it is
" infra cornua vel aures".

" Otherwise 'Jacobit^\ v, 40, § 3.

P. 294. " The corral", v, 21, § 5. But Scot refers to Avicenna, though
Wier does not ; nor do the names of the precious stones spoken of,
nor the remarks upon them, coincide with those in Wier at the above
reference.

P- 303. " Also that a woman", Wier vi, 9, § i, gives this, but his
words differ so much, that it can only be that both happened to notice
this common superstition.

P. 421. " Exorctso te creatiirani aqiicE . . . apostaits", v, 21, § 16,
giving "apostaticis". But Scot's giving the whole form, both of this
and of the exorcism of salt, and his italics, show that he took it from,
I suppose, the Missaie or other R. C. book of devotions, though
Wier may have given the idea.

P- 433- " Jacobits de Chusa", i, 13, § i, to middle of 6. Scot's first
paragraph is different ; in the rest he sometimes amplifies, some-
times condenses, sometimes omits Wier's words, and Wier says that
he gives J. de Chusa's verba Jide liter. The first prayer at its close is
in Scot shortened.

P. 445. " I conjure thee." This, like the ". . . creaturam salis", 421, is
given in Latin by Wier, v, 21, § 27, down to "adjuratus". Both the
Latin and English in Scot are the same, except a slight difference
after "judicare", arising from Scot, in this second instance, giving the
sense rather than the verba ipsissima.

P. 507. '•'•Rabbi Abraham . . . collected." Translated from i, 6, § 7.

P. 518. " For Beelzebub . . . fna^iium", i, 5, § 3.

519. Nisroch (5) ; Tartac [not Tarcat] (4) ; Beelphegor (i) ; Adrama-
lech (2) ; Chamos (6) ; Dagon (8) ; Astarte (7) ; Melchom (7) ; are in
Wier i, 5, § 3, with other gods, and in the order here marked. The

wording after each is also Wier's, as is the error "Ozee 9, 1 1" for 9, 10.
Both also make the same mistake as to the duality of Astarte and
Astaroth, because in i Kings ii, 5, she is called Astarthe in the Vulg.,
whence Wier took his names, and Scot followed him, and not his
English Bible. Both mention that the word means "riches, (S:c.",
and that it was a city of Og ; though both, curiously enough, here
forget the observation they had made elsewhere as to other cities,
that it was dedicated to, and therefore called after, the deity. Scot
omits also Wier's supposition that both Beelzebub and Beelphegor
were Priapus.

P. 520. This chapter, from the " heading" to the end, is derived
from i, 21, § I, to § 25, but is much abbreviated ; some titles also are
omitted ; but except for a slight change in the positions of both Dia-
bohis, and his last names, " owle", etc., Scot follows the order of
Wier.

P. 521. " Lares . . . cities", i, 6, § 6, except that W^ier has " cuam
agere" for both " trouble" — an odd word here — and " set to over-
see".

'•'•Viriaicnli terrei . . . drawe water." Follows generally,

though not quite literally, i, 22, § 5.

'•'•Dii geniales . . . birth", i, 6, § 6, shortened.

tajii." These being in the same order, are adopted from Wier i, 22,
§ 8-1 1, but much shortened. '"^HiidgiiC immediately follows as "Hut-
kin", § 12.

^'' Hiidgin. . . . ware a cap", i, 22, § 12. Here it is said —

" pileo caput opertus unde & vulgo Pileatum eum appellabant ru-
rales, hoc est, ein Hedeckin, lingua Saxonica."

'■'■ Faniiliares Danw7ies . . . Simon Samareus ... to come",

etc. — but of course omitting Feats and D7'. Binxot — are from i, 22, § 7.
Also "Alba; mulieres and Albse Sibyllas", though shortened. The "did
much harm" is from Wier. '■'■Deiamis, Agnan^ Grigii^ Ciaj'oibes''^ and
^'■Hoviouhira''^ follow in order, § 23-26. See note on Deiouns.

tion of the "Z> selcctV Wier and Ennms are not followed, but
Varro.

P. 525. "As namelie of beasts . . . Lattcs'\ is, I believe, from Strabo
originally, but by Scot was taken, I think, from Wier i, 6, § 2.

P. 533. "Pope Benedict the eight and ninth", i, 16, § 3 and 4. But
Scot's " seen a hundred years after", whereas Wier only has " postea",
seems to show that the former had referred to Platina.

II.

SCOT ON THE NAMES, ETC., OF DEVILS FROM WIER,

BUT PROBABLY THROUGH T. R., MENTIONED V. jgj.

P- yili '■ 13- " Seventie and nine." The list given by Scot is 68 +
I accidentally omitted + Beelzebub not mentioned + the 4 kings of
the N., S., E. and West = 74. Wier himself gives no total, but the
discrepancy in Scot may perhaps have arisen from his copying 79
from T. R., from whom, as an intermediary, and not directly from
Wier, or from some other, I think, from facts presently to be men-
tioned, it will be rendered probable that he copied.

P. 378. '■'■MarbasP After this name Scot omits from Wier's list —
"Purtias, alibi invenitur Busas, magnus Princeps & Dux est, cujus
mansio circa turrim Babylonis, & videtur in eo flamma foris, caput
autem assimilatur magno nycto-coraci. Autor est et promotor dis-
cordiarum, bellorum, rixarum et mendaciorum. Omnibus in locis non
intromittatur. Ad qua^sita respondet abunde. Sub sunt huic legiones
vingenti sex, partim ex ordine Throni, partim Angelorum." The edi-
tion of Wier that I have used, I may here remark, is chiefly that of
1660, but where any doubt arose, that of 1583. But from whence did
Wier obtain these things.? Under Belial ij give Scot's English) he
says : "Without doubt (I must confesse) I learned this of my master
Salomon ; but he told me not why he gathered them together, and
shut them up so. But I beleeve it was for the pride of this Beliall."
Secondly, under Gaap, he says: "I may not bewraie how and declare
the meanes to conteine him, bicause it is abhomination [nefandam],
and for that I have learned nothing from Salomon of his dignitie and
ofifice". And Wier has in his margin "Scelerati necromantici verba
sunt". Thirdly, Wier, in his address before his Pseudomonarchia, says:
"banc . . . ex Acharonticorum Vasallorum archivo subtractam"; and
at the close of this address : " Inscribitur vero a maleferiato hoc
hominum genere OtScium spirituum, vel. Liber officiorum spirituum,
seu Liber dictus Empto.[rium] Salomonis, de principibus & regibus
daemoniorum, qui cogi possunt divina vertute & humana. At mihi
nuncupabitur Pseudomonarchia Djemonum."

Pp- 377-9 J- Scot, in these second, third, and fourth chapters, follows
Wier, but for these reasons did not, I think, directly translate him:

1. As stated under Marbas^ p. 378, Piirflas is omitted.

2. Three sentences are retained in their original Latin, as though
the translator could not understand them, [ci) Under Bm'balos, ". . .
in signo sagittarii sylvestris", he probably knowing Sagittarius, but not
sure as to what sign or who Sagittarius sylvestris might be. (;) Under
Leraie, ". . . quos optimos objicit tribus diebus''. Wier here places
" optimos" as the third word, but the sense to me and my friends is
an unsolved puzzle, {c) Under Oze, ". . . Duratque id regnum ad
horam" (but Wier omits the "ad"), "And this sovereignty lasts
an hour [and no longer], differing in this from ordinary mono-

mania." 3. Under Bileth Scot and Wier say, ". . . as for Amai-
inon'\ and Scot in the margin has "Vide Amaimon"; yet neither
mentions him under a heading, nor more than by name, as " Amay-
mon king of the East", in chap. iv. 4. Under Murmur, Scot ends
with " and ruleth thirtie legions", but Wier omits this, as do both
in the cases of Oze, Vine, and Saleos. 5. There are differences and
slips of translation which Scot could not, I think, have made.
{a) Scot invariably, in the rest of his works, speaks of " the order
of virtutes", but in this chapter, where it is used five times under
Agares, Barbatos, Pursoii, and Belial, and ch. iv, p. 395, it is " vertues".
{p) Barbatos is said to come " with foure kings, which bring com-
panies and great troopes". But Wier has "cum quatuor regibus tubas
ferentibus". From this it is clear that the translator read "tubas" as
"tribus". {c) "Ugly viper" is the translation of "viperae species deter-
rima". [d) " He giveth answers of things present, past, and to come",
is in Wier " Dat perfecte responsa vera de . . . futuris & abstrusis";
Scot omitting both "perfecte" and "abstrusis". See under i?(?w for both
(£■) and {d). {e) '■'■Biine Muta loquitur voce", rendered in Scot, " he
speaketh with a divine voice". The translator apparently looked out for
"mutus" in a dictionary, such as Th. Cooper's, where in Old English
he found "dumme"; and read it — as I at first sight did, and with great
astonishment, though I confess my thoughts were running on the
puzzle — "divine". () \]r\d&r Bileth, ". . . before whome go trumpets
and all kind of melodious musicke", Scot has, "or if he have not the
chaine of spirits [the book called Vincjdum Spiriltawt], certeinelie he
will never feare nor regard him after", but Wier has, "... sciet baud
dubie exorcista, malignos spiritus postea eum non verituros, et semper
viliorem habituros". ig) " Sitri . . . willinglie deteineth secrets of
women", is in Wier, "secreta libenter detegit faeminarum". Here there
are in the English two gross blunders, as is evident on reading the
rest of the Latin text. " Ludificansque", also, is not " mocking", but
"toying with them", "ut se luxuriose nudent". (h) \J nderPaimon,Wier's
"in Empto.[rium] Salomonis" is "in Cireulo Salojnom's". "Aquilonem"
is " North-west", though Th. Cooper and Holyokes Rider, and, I
believe, all dictionaries, only give it and its adjectives as North,
North-east, and Northern. "Accedant", also, is translated "may be
reckoned", to the complete extinction of the sense. (2) Belial is,
"eorum qui ex Ordine [Potestatum] ceciderunt", and is translated, "of
them which fell being of the orders". (7) " He is found in the forme
of an exorcist in the bonds of spirits", is, in more ways than one, a
strange and most ambiguous rendering, altogether unlike Scot, of
"Forma exorcistae [the form of exorcising that is to be usedjinvenitur in
[the book] Vinculo Spirituum" . {k) " Si autem se submittere noluerit
Vinculum Spirituum legatur, quo sapientissimus Salomon",etc., becomes
" If . . . let the bond of spirits be read, the spirits chaine [appar-
ently an unintentional doubling of the previous words], is sent for him
wherewith wise Salomon", etc. I might add that twice in the course
of this chapter " sapientissimus S." becomes "wise S.", in " vase vitreo'
" in a brazen vessel", and "in puteum grandem" " into a deep lake or
hole", and twice afterwards " lake" only. () Under Furfur, " fulgura,

corns cationes & tonitrua" is translated "thunders and lightnings,
and blasts", {in) In Malphas, "artifices maximos" is "artificers". («)
\J nder Ve>ar, "Contra inimicos exorcistre per dies tres . . . homines
inficit" becomes, without qualification, "hekilleth men in three days".
(o) Under Sydonay^ "Cum hujus ofiicia exercet exorcista", instead of
"When the exorcist would make use of the offices [the incantations
for] of this [spirit]", or " When the exorcist would make use of the
forms of invocation proper to this spirit", it is translated, " When the
conjurer exerciseth this office". The next words, " fit [.'' sit] fortis", be-
come " let him be abroad", "foris" having been read instead of "fortis".
" If his cap be on his head", Wier has " si coopertus", " if he be over-
whelmed" [with fear, etc.], the translator possibly wishing to express
this by "if his cap be so far on his head" [through fear as to cover his
eyes], then, etc. Besides this, there is an ambiguity in Wier which is
fully followed in the translator. In Wier we have : " si vero coopertus
fuerit, ut in omnibus detegatur, efficiet: Quod si non fecerit exorcista,
ab Amaymone in cunctis decipietur :" I can only suppose from the
punctuation that the "Quod si non", etc., was intended to refer to his not
being '' fortis", and (as in Scot) "warie and standing on his feete". {p)
Under Gaap, Scot says, " if anie exorcist . . . nor see him"; Wier has
the same, but follows it up with "nisi per artem". On the other hand,
Wier has no equivalent for "insensibility", (r) SJiax : ". . .there
he speaketh divinely" is " loquitur de divinis rebus", an error Scot
could not have made, and which is not made elsewhere in this chapter,
(i') Procell .• " . . . in the shape of an angell, but speaketh darkly of
things hidden", is in Wier, "in specie angelica, sed obscura valde :
loquitur de occultis". () Raiiin : ". . . he stealeth wonderfully out of
the kings house"; Wier, "mire ex regis domi 71? aia suffiiratur". (v)
In Vine, "lapideos domos" is translated "stone walles". (ta) Flaiiros:
Wier says,"vere respondet. Si fuerit in triangulo mentitur in cunctis."
Scot follows the same punctuation, but had he translated it,he,as a man
of intelligence, must have seen that the (.) before "Si" should have been
struck out and placed after "triangulo", or a "non" inserted after "Si", for
this triangle was made specially for the exorcist's safety and the spirit's
obedience and truthful speaking (see ww^qx BilctJi, FnrfnriindSha.x^.
It must, however, be confessed to be a mark of haste in Scot to have
admitted such mistakes, even though he only copied, the more so as
he must have known the Psciidoinonarchia. " And deceiveth in other
things, and beguileth in other business", is a duplicate translation of
"et fallit in aliis negotiis". The omission of "twentie" (viginti) before
"legions" may be a press error, but the "de divinitate", translated "of
divinity", must be, I think, a translator's error, for it really means "of
the Divinity" (see " Purson"). {x) \] nd&r Bieer, Wier has "conspicitur
in signo*"; under Decarabia, "venit simili*"; under Aym, " altero
[capiti, simili] homini duos * habenti." Clearly the book or MS. used
by Wier was in these places illegible, or more likelythe copier had been
unable to fill in the wanting word or words, and indicated this by a*.
But Scot's authority did not understand it on its first occurrence
under Butr, and, not mentioning any sign, translates it, " is scene in
this sign;"! {y) The names of the fiends differ also sometimes in

spelling ; omitting such instances as " i" for "y'', "c" for "k", etc., I give
Wier first, followed by Scot's form. "Bathym", alibi " Marthim" —
" Bathin", "Mathin"; "Pursan"— " Purson"; "Loray"— "Leraie", this
latter being wrong, because his alias is "Oray". Wier, by the way, also
shows that " Leraie" was not pronounced " Leraje", as given in the
second edition of Scot. " Ipes", alias "Ayperos" — " Ipos", "Ayporos";
"Naberus" — "Naberius", probably the wrong form; "Roneve" — "Ro-
nove"; "Forres" — "Foras"; "Marchocias" — "Marchosias"; "Chax" —
"Shax"; "Pucel"— "Procell"; "Zagam"— "Zagan"; " Volac"— "Valac";
"Androalphus"— "Andrealphus"; " Oze"— "Ose"; " Zaleos"— "Saleos";
" Wal, 1660", is " Vual (as Scot), 1583". It will be noticed that "e" is
five times used for "o", a MS. copyist's error.

I think I had some other pi-oofs in a MS. sheet since lost; but these
are now overmany to prove that Scot had access to some other copy
than Wier's Pseudomonarchia, and made use of it, and that his trans-
lator was not very conversant with Latm. Wier, it may be added,
puts "Secretum . . . horum" in one line, and without a capital to the
" Tu", and gives no explanation of the words in any way, and Scot con-
firms our conclusion from these facts by the marginal, " This was |
the work of j one T. R." | etc., and the words " written [&c.] vpo
parchment" seem to show that this 1570 translation was in MS.
(See also General Notings, p. 418.)

P. 379. '■'■EligorP I do not understand the double titles here and
elsewhere given, nor why "miles" should here be translated "aknight",
while under Zepar, Fiircas, Miirnur, and Alloccr it is ''soldier". In
chapter iii, p. 393, is given the time when knights (" Milites", Wier)
may be bound, but nothing, of course, is said of " soldiers".

P. 383. " Tocz.", like a contraction, but Wier has "Tocz" without
any stop.

P. 384. '"''Asta^'oth.'''' Scot, merely copying, is not responsible for her
being a male. At p. 519 and p. 525, he writing, calls Astarte a " she
idoU".

P. 389. '■''Valac . . . with angels wings like a boie", cannot, I think,
be Scot's translation of " uti puer alis angeli".

■ " Gomo7-yP Wier says " ducali corona", but the rest is the

same; and it must be remembered that a fiend (as in Incubus and Suc-
cubus) could be of either sex.

P. 390. "v4_y;;z ... a light firebrand." Here (as elsewhere in Scot)
we find, as was then often done, the past of verbs ending in t or d
elided the ed, or, rather, coalesced them. Wier has " ingentem
facem ardentem".

P. 391. '■''Flauros . . . if he be commanded." Wier adds " virtute
numinis".

P. 392. '■'•Note that a legio7iP Wier simply has "Legio 6666". The
rest is, in all probability, Scot's own.

P. 393. "Ch. 3" is "§ 69" of Wier.

"Ch. 4" is " Citatio Pr^edictorum Spirituum", and though

not marked as a new chapter, is one having § i, § 2, etc.

These are the variations between Wier and Scot in this

chapter 4, or Citatio, Wier being in Latin, Scot in English, {a) " For



Extracts from VVier. 563

one [companion] must always be with you"; "si prassto fuerit". (b)
394,"effect"; Wier adds," imo tua; anima? perditione". {c) "And note",
etc., is Scots own. {d) The *^ before "hoHe trinitie" is in Scot only.
(^) Scot omits Rafter "holie crosse". () Wier's "anathi Enathiel" is
in Scot " Anathiel". ( <,') The " Heli, Messias", after "Gayes" in Scot, are
in Wier at the end of the list, iji) Scot's "Tolimi" is Wier's "Tolima".
(z) [Second list of names.] Scot's "Horta"is Wier's "hortan"; his"Vege
dora", " vigedora", Wier's letters, in 1583, being several of them so
separated that they could easily be read as two words ; Scot's " Ysesy"
is "ysyesy". (7) [Third list.] Scot's " Elhrac" is Wier's " Elhroc";
Ebanher", "eban her", {k) P. 666, Scot's " Cryon" is " irion"; "Sabboth"
is, as before, more rightly "sabaoth". And I may add that while every
word in Scot is capitalised except "dora", really the sequel of "Vige",
only "Deus Sabaoth", "A" and "n", "Rex", "Joth", "Aglanabrath",
"El'' "Enathiel", "Amazim", "Elias", and " Messias" of the first list,
none of the second list, " Elhroch" the first of the third list, and
none of the fourth list are capitalised.

P. 395. "As is conteined in the booke called", etc. This ambiguous
sentence is better explained by Wier's " Continua ut in libro * Annuli
Salomonis continetur", that is, continue the " etc." as etc. It may
be added that the *, the mark of an omission, is omitted in the
English.

Scot (>., his authority) wholly omits Wier's final § 5 :

"Hasc blasphema & execranda hujus mundi fttx & sentina poenam
in magos prophanos bene constitutam, pro scelerato mentis ausu jure
meretur." Scot, 1 think, would be unlikely not to translate this, or be
incited by it to write something similar, but it would be wholly
against the purport of T. R. Some of the differences entered into,
both just above and previously, seem to favour the belief that two
independent copies of the Einpto. Salomonis were used, but very
many merely show carelessness, and possibly no great amount of
Latin. The giving of the name"^ Secretum secretorum", etc., at the
same place, viz., just at the end of the enumeration, etc., of the prin-
cipal devils, might seem to favour a copying from Wier; but we must
remember that the Evipto. Salomonis from which these leaves are
copied may itself, and possibly by way of proving its genuineness, have
copied these details from an earlier, or supposedly earlier, " Secretum
secretorum".



Additions to Part I, p. 558.

Wier, i, 7, § 10. " Similiter ex parte postica & uteri coUo novit
implicatos crines, arenas copiam, clavos ferreos, ligna, vitra confracta,
stupam, lapides, ossa, et similia prsestigiis movere, offuscata interim
oculorum acie : insecta auribus furtive immittere, qute postea vel pro-
deant, vel evolent." See also iv, c. 7, § 1-4. Cf. Scot, p. 132. In all
probability a mere coincidence of thought.

Wier, iv, c. 11, § 8. "In lacte tres sunt substantise commixtce,
nimirum butyrum, caseus & serum.'' Cf Scot, p. 281, copied verbatim.

P. 2. " Ring bells." Still done in Switzerland, and, I think, else-
where.

P. ic. "As Merlin." Cf. p. 72.

P. 14. " That cause . . . taken away." The mediseval Latin say-
ing, " ablata causa toUitur effectus". Repeated p. 319.

P. 17. " W. W. 1582." [In his preface.] A proof that witches were
not then burnt in England; but it shows how the question of witch-
craft was then exercising the people that Ade Davie, the wife of a
husbandman, pp. 55-7, thought that she was to be burnt. W. W. says
also that Mr. Justice Darcie, persuading Eliz. Bennett to confess,
said : " As thou wilt have favour confesse the truth. For so it is,
there is a man of great learning and knowledge come over lately into
our Oueenes Majestic, which hath advertised her what a companie
and numbers of Witches be within Englande: whereupon I and other
of her Justices have received Commission for the apprehending of as
many as are within these limites, and they which doe confesse the
truth of their doeings, they shall have much favour : but the other
they shall be burnt and hanged" (B. 6). She and others that con-
fessed had the favour of being hanged like the rest; possibly they had
the additional favour of being hanged first. The first notice that I
have yet come across of burning is that of Mother Lakeman at
Ipswich, 1645. W. W., in his Dedication, speaks of these witches as
" rygorously punished. Rygorously, sayd I ? Why it is too milde
and gentle a tearme for such a merciiesse generation. I should rather
have sayd most cruelly [? civilly] executed : for that no punishment
can be thought upon, be it never so high a degree of tormet, which
may be deemed sufficient for such a divelishe & danable practise";
and again, " the magistrates of forren landes . . . burning them with
fire, whome the common lawe of Englande (with more mercie then is
to be wished) strangleth with a rope." The burning was, I presume,
inflicted under the ecclesiastical law, De ha^ret. comburendo.

But burning was not at first universally adopted (a proof that it
was not imposed by the common law), for at the Assizes at Maidstone,
1652, they were hanged, but "Some . . . wished rather they might
be burnt to Ashes : alledging that it was a received opinion amongst
many [for in some cases it was held as proof against a witch that her
mother had been burnt for the same crime] that the body of a witch
being burnt, her blood is prevented thereby from becomming
hereditary to the Progeny in the same evill, which by hanging is
not.'

P. 19. " Excommunicat persons." Evidence of Scot's haste, and of



Genei'al Notings on Scof s Text. 565

his trusting to his memory. Wishing to find the Latin for "runna-
waie", I looked into M. M. and found : "Nota quod excommunicati,
item participes & socii criminis, item infames, et criminosi nee servi
contra dominos admittentur ad agendum, & testificandum in causa
fidei quacunque." It will be observed that he remembered " infames"
as " infants", and, as there might have been a misprint in his copy, I
have consulted all — not-a short list^in the British Museum. Possi-
bly he was influenced by W. W.'s book, which had taken a strong
hold on him, if it were not one of the causes of his writing, for there,
children from 634^ to 9 years (infants in law) were taken as witnesses
against their mothers, while one woman's proof was that her infant
in arms pointed to the house !

P. 24. " To the God speed." This, by the context, might be taken as
meaning that he came to a fortunate issue. But it was, and is, in use
as given to a person setting forth on a journey, etc. Hence, here,
and especially at p. 481, it seems to mean that he came at the com-
mencement, when one receives or gives this salutation. As is recorded
in an instance at Windsor, " R. S. probably gave the God speed at
the assembly, and God's name so frayed the witches that they fled,
and so frayed the devil that he was conquered in a hand-to-hand
fight."

"At shrift." This was laid down by Roman Catholic priests,

though it was, and is, a rule with them that no confessor can reveal a
confession, even before a court of law !

P. 41. " But bargained to." The sense requires " [not] to observe".
Probably a slip of the printer, possibly through the " but", and the
concurrence of two t's.

P. 42. '■'■ Lavolla." A fact strangely overlooked (as is David's danc-
ing) by the damners of dancing.

" Socke the corps." The same in p. 124 explains that this is

sewing the body in its winding-sheet or sheets. The phrase is
Kentish.

P. 45. " Young maister", z'.^., their new master, they having just come
under the devil's sway.

P. 48. " Of fiftie." In Scot, as in others, we find uses of "of "which
are to us strange. Here is a clearer example than usual of its
synonymity w ith our " by". Cf also p. 76, and Auth. Ver., i Cor.
XV, 5-8.

P. 50. " The veines have passage." For as little, others — as Paracel-
sus, by R. Browning, etc. — have been credited — to the discomfiture of
Harvey— w-ith the knowledge of the circulation of the blood. Even
Shakespeare is so credited by some whose knowledge will assert posi-
tively that the moon is nof made of green cheese.

P. 60. " Their not fasting on fridaies." Scot's Protestantism here
went beyond the ordained Protestantism of his age, as did that of B.
Jonson's Cob.

P. 'j'6. " Clime up and take it." Not the nest, but his own belongings.
A good example of the pronoun not referring to its grammatical ante-
cedent, but to the antecedent which was most in the mind of the
narrator.

General Notino;s on Scofs Text.



p. 80. "Away withall"^" Companion with" here, in other places
" agree with". An expression that sounds odd to us, but then used
practically and metaphorically, from the idea of companionship on
a journey, when companionship was almost or altogether necessary.

P. 84. " The [night]mare." Most, I suppose — among them I myself
— have known that these occur at times to a person in a deep sleep.
My fourth nightmare, a horrible, troubled, and inconsequent dream,
so far as I can remember, occurred some two years ago ; three, at
only a month or two's interval between each, occurred years ago, when
in a snake country. Then one appeared to be on and in my primitive
bed, or wriggling about my wattle and daub bedroom, the only room I
had. I thought myself wide-awake, bed, bedroom, and furniture being
plainly visible, and my thoughts and conclusions were as coherent,
and myself as self-possessed as at any moment of my life, until a
sense of unreality came upon me, and by two or more vigorous efforts
of both mind and body I awoke myself. My experience, and that
recorded p. 84, will explain various ghostly stories — I do not say all —
wherein the sufferer asserts positively, and believes, that he was wide-
awake.

" As sure as a club." The derivation and meaning — as sure

as is a tangible club that can or will strike you — is obvious; but I have
heard it at the card-table, as though derived from the sureness of the
cards thus named. An example of a false application arising from
the apparent sameness of the words, and possibly in the first instance
fi-om a jocular use of the phrase.

P. 85. "Hampton." Folk-lore worth recording. I conjecture, but
only conjecture, that this word was suggested by the hempen or flaxen
garments laid for his use, its sequent "hamten" being coined to rhyme
with " stampen".

P. 87. " To her that night." I have placed "him" in the margin,
my own conjecture and the reading of the British Museum MS. of
parts of Scot. But in Fletcher's M. Thomas, iv, 6, we have the same
spell, with some shght variations, and ending —

" She would not stir from him [St. George] that night",

which more agrees with Shakespeare's quotation in Lear, iii, 4 — St.
Withold

"Bid her alight
And her [the nightmare's] troth plight."

" ViderimP, etc. Altered, apparently, from Vulgate, which

has "Videntes . . . essent pulchrse", etc.

'■^FiliosDeiP Scot here alters ^^FiHi" to the objective, because

it follows " doo interpret". He does the same elsewhere, whether it
be English verb or preposition that precedes. Thus, 422, we have
"Vitas Fairum", htcsiust it follows "prooved"; 458, '■'■'xw Speciilo exciii-
ploriinC^ ; and 381,* "in Ch'culo Saloiioiiis ; 544, " Spiritum", because
the words follow " signifieth". We find one instance of the same in
Nash's Summers Last Will and Test.



General Notings on Scot' s Text. 567

p. 90. " He accuseth." Bodin, ii, 6.

P. 91. "A faggot maker." Bodin, ii, 6.

P. 94. " In tiie western Hands", as in the " still vexed Ber-
moothes".

P. 95. " Saccaring bell " = a sacring bell, the bell rung at the
elevation of the host, when all true, i.e.^ Roman Catholic, worshippers
fall on their knees.

"A morrowe masse"— a morning mass. All masses, except,

I think, on Christmas Day and Good Friday, and except in certain
churches, where the older usage was by prescription allowed, being in
Scot's time, and now, celebrated before noon. This rule was made
by the Pope in 1550-58.

P. 99. " (His reason onelie reserved)." Not Bodin's reason, but
that of the sailor.

P. 104. '■'■Abactick." Bel and the Drao^oft, 3^, 27-

" One syllable nor five words." A curiously sounding

phrase ; but he seems to have used " syllable" as we do, figuratively,
meaning, " in the same sense", while the five words are, " not even
differing five words in the form of expression".

P. 107. "Witch is disposed", [to plague] being understood.

P. 1 10. " Make so foolish a bargaine or doo such homage to the
devill." We would more exactly say " bargaine [with] or".

P. III. " Exod. 22" [18]. Did Scot quote from memory? The
Sept., ov TToiTjaere [var.] Trepifttwaere Ox. ed., nor have I found Scot's
verb as a recognised variant.

P. 113. "Eccl." is twice in the margin put for " Ecclus.", the
Apocryphal Book. In p. 145, by, I suppose, a printer's error, " Eccle."
is put for " Ecclus." Elsewhere, Scot rightly gives " Ecclus."

P. 115. "Osee 6" [i, 2]. Vulg. has "2. Quia ipse cepit, et sanabit
nos ; percutiet, et curabit nos. 3. Vivificabit nos post duos dies."
The "ego", etc., is only found in Deut. xxxii, 39, where the Vulg. has
" vivere faciam".

" If you looke into [what I have written concerning] Habar",

etc.

P. 119. "Besmearing with an ointment." Such beliefs then cur-
rent justify more than is now supposed the beliefs of Elizabeth and
her counsellors, and the execution of her would-be murderer.

" Wolves doong." A bit of folk-lore, which has, I think,

sufficient vraiseinblance as to be worthy of trial, the more so as it is
said to this day that a young dog shows fear at the smell of a dried
piece of wolf's skin.

P. 126. '■'Ells. Barton." See Fronde's Hist., v, i. She was of
Aldington, Kent, and a servant of the father or grandfather of Jane
Cobbe, Reg. Scot's first wife.

P. 127. " In his mightie power." Either the "in" of the line above
brought about its insertion here, or, more likely, it was used as it is
" in his name", though in such a case as this we should say "through"
or " by".

P. 132. " 1572." This booklet is not known, I believe ; nor is it in
the Stat. Regs.

P. 142. "Eccle" [Ecclus, 49, 16, 17].

P. 145. " Covered himself with a net." An excellent example that
this phrase meant disguising himself, or trying to conceal himself.
It may seem odd, that " with a net" should mean this, because one
naturally thinks of a single fold ; but a fisherman conceals his head
and body in folds of netting.

P. 146. " Finger in a hole." I presume it is meant that Saul shut
himself out of all means of knowing what really went on, as much as
if he had closed up a hole in a shut door or window-shutter, through
which alone he could see — or have light thrown upon — the subject.

P. 147. " She saith to herself" [but intentionally loud enough for
Saul to hear].

P. 150. " Right ventriloquie." This excellent investigation of the
Bible story might be read with advantage by those who even now
hold that Samuel really appeared by God's allowance or command.
Such a belief involves three impossibilities. First, that God having
repeatedly declined to answer Saul by lawful means, now b)^ an after-
thought changed His mind. Secondly, that He who from the time of
Moses had so condemned witchcraft, that Saul had put it down as
far as he could, and that with blood, now favoured the action of a
witch, and that in so notorious a case that it could not but be, as it
was, known to all Israel. Thirdly, that the Deity must have put a
lying spirit into the mouth of a true and God-blessed prophet, since
the prophecy did not come true in more than one important point.

P. 151. "Ai'as and Sadaias." Here he rightly distinguishes the
two ; but in 141, and in his list of authors consulted, he gives "Rabbi
Sedaias Haias". " Haias Hai", or "Haja", was a celebrated Baby-
lonian Rabbi, born 969 A.D.; died 1038. Sedaias or Saadja flourished
circa 900-40.

P. 155. "Called Pythonissa." Not by that exact word, either in
Sept., or Vulg., or Greek N.T. Vulg., i Sam. xxviii, 7, has " mulier
pythonem habens"; and in Acts xvi, 16, the Greek, the Vulg., and
Beza have similar wordings.

" Liber pater." " Liber" is " Bacchus" in Scot himself ;

but Porphyrius— whom Th. Cooper and Calepine follow — says of
" Liber pater": " Eundem Solem apud superos : Liberum patrem in
terris : Apollinem apud inferos."

P. 158. " Then a cousening ciueane'"=Than [believe that], etc. I
note: i. That the (.) before " Then" should probably be a (,), though
occasionally we have (;) where only (,) is required. 2. That as in this
book we rarely have " then" for " than", I conjecture that this mode
of spelling was not at the time universal, but only commencing.

P. 159. '■'■ Nemo scitP Slightly altered from the question, i Cor.
ii, 1 1, and not the Vulgate words, but apparently more those of Beza.

" Tji solus''' [2 Chron. vi, '})^- Vulg. reads, " tu enini solus

nosti corda JiHoruin hominem"; it has also " corda", where David
speaks to Solomon similarly, i Chron. xxviii, 9 ; but " universas men-
tium cogitationes" follows it.

" Ego Deus'^ [Jer. xvii, 10]. He omits "probaiis^^ before

" roics''' in Vulg.



General Notings on Scof s Text. 569

P. 162. " Epotherses." Rightly, in 163, " Epitherses".

P. 166. " By revolution." I presume by revolution of the planets
(and stars, as was then thought), until they came into a certain "con-
stellation", i.e., position as regards one another. This I gather from
a previous page.

[Margin] "Zach. lo." We have here a further example of

the loose references, common in those days, to the Bible made by
both Roman Catholics and Protestants. The first clause is in sense
is given Zach. lo [,2], and somewhat, Isai.44[9, 10]; but the remainder
from Ps. cxxxv, 16, 17; though "months", etc., is placed third instead
of first, while "let them shew" is, I take it, a variant of Isai. xli, 23.

P. 168. "Firmament." His error in writing "earth" shows his haste,
and explains in part the wording of his Scripture quotations. Cf. pp.
19, 174. But see also note, p. 503.

P. 169. "The increase of the moon." This, his doubtful doubt as to
the Remora, his belief that the bone in a carp's head staunched blood,
show that Scot was not naturally sceptical in matters of knowledge,
but that he only gave up the beliefs of his day after investigation.

P. 171. '"'' MahoDiets dove." He would express his belief, as Wier
does more openly, that it (as the eagle) was taught to do its feats.

P. 173. " '7X'''"- In those days the H, now confined to the capitals,
was used, as here in the original, for the small letter r].

P. 174. "Pharaoh the Persian kings." Other references to the
Pharaohs in this book show that these curious transpositions were due
to haste of composition and of revisal both of his MS. and of the
printed copy.

P. 176. "Manacies." Not having met with this form, I presume
that it is a press error for "menacies". It is so changed in the second
edition.

P. 180. " Faile to dreame by night." Scot's general statement may
be true, but must in some instances be modified. From my youth, for
many — say at least twenty — years, I tried to remember my dreams for
this very purpose, and could remember them for a short while very
well ; but never could I find that what I had thought on during the
day, or the days before, gave even a suggestion to my dreams. Thrice,
however, of late years, I have been able to trace my dream to some-
thing I had casually thought of, though not meditated on. This
edition of Scot, as well as the question of witchcraft, has occupied
both my mind and time since November, and it is now October, yet
not a single dream has had reference to anything connected with
these subjects. Similarly, family matters have both busied me and
worried me for some months, and yet these matters have never in-
truded themselves, not even when my dreams, and at one time a near
approach to nightmare, showed that my digestion was out of order.
From my own instance, I should rather say that dreams most
frequently seem to be natural reliefs to the thoughts that I had indulged
in, or that might have beset me, in my waking hours.

P. 182. "Of physicall dreames." I suppose he means dreams
from physical causes.

p. 1S2. '■'MelancholicallP Proceeding from "black bile", which, in
the opinions of that day, produced melancholy, that form of madness
called melancholia. I would add that " melancholy" is often used in
Scot for mad melancholia, and for the supposed humour melancholy
or black bile, and that, unless this is borne in mind, some of his
sentences will be misunderstood.

P. 183. "De Profundis." Ps. cxxix; Vulg. cxxx ; Prayer Book. All
that follow are given consecutively, I think, in the Rit. Rom. OJJicium
Defuiictorum.

" Pleasant and certain dreams." Formerly an at least

English notion, as expressed by the servant-lover of Bombastes :

" And morning dreams, they say, come true."

P. 184. " Eleoselinum." Translated in the second edition as
" mountain parsley."

" Slum" in the second edition is "yellow water-cress".

" Acarum vulgare", " common acorus" — our " Asarum

Europ."

P. 185. "An errand . . . from farre countries." A similar tale is
told — in some English work against witchcraft after Scot — of an
Italian judge who thus tried a supposed witch.

P. 187. "A thousand for one that." Here the "that" does not, as
with us, refer to the "one" but to the "thousand" :="he might have
cited a thousand that fell out contrarie" for one that fell out truly.
A thousand for one, though four words seem, as it were, to have
been considered one thought. See Shakespearean noting under this
page.

JP. 190. "To offer ... to Moloch." Curious that Scot, knowing
that fire was accounted holy, should not have seen that this idolatrous
rite was in its essence a purifying, and possibly an expiatory, one.

P. 198. ^'■Menehas''' (example, Deut. xix, 10). Hebr. ^rt.H^- Here he
does not quite agree with Wier, i, § 9.

" Philosophers table." Cf. Strutt, s. n. The philosopher's

game, played on a " table" or board.

" Sober writer." Of course, ironical.

" Of each letters." Either misprint for letter, or rather, per-
haps, a loose way of saying "of each [set ofj letters", or "of the
letters of each person's name or names".

— " Unequal number of vowels." A bit of folk-lore as yet, I

think, unnoticed.

P. 200. "Added the Apocrypha." Council of Trent, 1550, made
them of equal authority with those which the Church of England
defines as " Canonical Scriptures".

P. 202. " True loves." Garden pansies, viola tricolor, L. (Britten
and H.), four-leaved grass, occasional variations of the three-leaved
grass, trefoil.

" To our left side." So far an explanation why horse-shoes,

salt, etc., are thrown against ill-luck over the left shoulder.

P. 205. '■'■Sero rubens.'" P. 169, Scot quotes this in English as a

lawful divining from natural causes, in fact, as a vveatherwise obser-
vation.

P. 206. "Stella erratts." I presume he means a planet, partly be-
cause a comet was then thought a portent, differing in origin and
nature from a star, partly because Cicero uses the plural in the sense
of planets.

"A'(9; ^j." Not from Vulg. or Beza ; probably his own

rendering.

P. 209. " Milvus" [Jer. viii, 7]. Sentence as in Vulg., while the
Geneva version, like our Authorised version, has storke.

P. 210. " Significators", i.e., of the planets which have meanings
according to their positions and co-positions or " constellations".

P. 212. " Sapiens." A sop of flattery for their client.

P. 213. "Maketh themselves cuckoldes."=Who by their negligence
and ignorance cause themselves to be made cuckolds, while pretend-
ing to know every other person's future.

P. 225. " Phaers Virgil" [B. 4, adjin?^. Scot, however, has printed
each line as two.

P. 230. " Balme", etc. Note that each longer line has an extra
syllable at the end.

P. 232. " This is as true a copy." Apparently a press error for
"This is a true copy", as given in the second edition, the printer hav-
ing, inadvertently, ahiiost reduplicated the "is".

P. 233. "►^-•Thomas." His and our "N." (or sometimes "John",
etc.), anyone who may be the invoker.

" A popish periapt." The distances between these letters

are somewhat variable, the "ka" and "am" are near enough to be
syllables. But 1 have not misspent my time in a search for the true
original. *

P. 234. "Whistle for a pardon." An expression still used for
other things than pardon. Possibly founded on an ironical reference
to the nautical idea, that when you whistle for a wind you get it, and
more of it than you want. I have been spoken to for whistling on
board ship. More probably, however, because whistling denoting
want of care and thought, as in bench-whistler, one might as well ex-
pect a pardon or the thing wished for, after merely whistling for it, as
expect larks to drop into one's mouth.

P. 238. " Plumme." I know not whether Scot meant to translate
" Stircus " literally, but it would be curious to know whether this
signification was formerly given to " plum". It could well bear it.

P. 240. " Constant opinion ":=firm belief or firm faith.

" Ho7ne}-ica Mcdicatio.'" The physician was " Ferrerius ",

alias "Auger", or " Oger Ferrier" — not " f^errarius", as given through-
out the text, in his list of authors, and in his contents — born at Toulouse,
151 3, physician in ordinary to Catherine de Medicis, and afterwards
returned to his birthplace, where he died in 1588. B. 2, ch. ii, of his
Vera Dicdcndi modus is headed " De Homerica Medicatione". And
here I would at once say, that for the discovery of "Ferrmus" and
of the following passages, and of the cause of Scot's curious blunder,
the reader and myself are indebted to my ever-ready Shakespearean

friend, the Rev. W. A. Harrison. " When," says Ferrier, " patients
will not yield to ordinary treatment, one must have recourse to another
kind," which he describes generally in the margin as " Amuleta ".
And first he speaks of "appensiones et physic^e alligationes", then
of " Caracteras & Carmina". These, he says, Galen (and Trallianus)
at first ridiculed, but that Trallian had seen (I believe in his mind's
eye) a tractate of Galen's in which, as the heading of a chapter, or
somewhere else, were the words " Homericam medicationem ; quod
HoiJicriis sitppj-fssjun verbis sans^tiine77i^ et inysteriis sanatos effectus
p?-od!den'ty The italicised passage is that nonsense-sentence of Scot's
at the end of the chapter. It could only have arisen from Scot's
haste, but was also due to the fact that, as in the British Museum
copy of the Lyons edition, 1574, the "s'' of "verbis" is so faint as
to give the not careful reader the form "verbi '. But Ferrier, like
Scot, attributed such cures to imagination or a " fixed fansie", or "con-
stant opinion"; on which also I would refer to Sir H. Holland's book
on the Effect of Iniairination in Disease. Thus he continues : " Depre-
hendiitaque curationis hujus eventum non a caracteribus non ex carmina
permanare. Sed tanta est vis animi nostri, ut si c;[uid honesti sibi
persuaserit, atque in ea persuasione firmiter perseveravit, idipsum
quod concepit agat, & potenter operetur. . . Si neque fidentem, neque
dilSdentem nihilominus vis animi agentis operabatur. Id in dentium
doloribus . . aperte videre licet. Nam prtecantator ita movet non
reluctantis gegroti animum, ut dolor . . . sensim extinguatur. . . At si
forte cCger dififidet, aut plane ridiculum existimet remedium . . prae-
cantante vis nulla erit. . . Non sunt ergo carmina, non sunt caracteres
quo talia possunt, sed vis animi confidentis, & cum patiente concordis."
Wier V, ig, §1-4, gives the Ferrerius quotation, as well as his name,
rightly. The staunching of blood by words refers to the cme in the
Odyssey.

P. 242. " Through sudden feare." Similar cases are known to
physicians at the present day, whether through fear or some other
sudden emotion. A Protestant medical man can well believe some
of the tales of diseased pilgrims cured at, say, the shrine of Our Lady
of Lourdes, though no more believing in such miracles than do
Roman Catholics when Protestant anointers anoint and sometimes
cure through the same cause.

P. 243. " Hearbe Alysson." So called because it cured hydro-
phobia (Pliny). Phil. Holland says, " Some take it to be Asperuia,
the wood-rose" ; Holyokes Rider gives " rubia minor, cannabis
agrestis".

P. 244. " Scarifie." Might be done with a gum lancet ; but the
magical tooth might have the advantage in some instances of
affecting the thoughts, and through them the body, as noted,
p. 240.

" Cj «(??." This, preceded by "4* Jesus autem transiens

^ per medium illorum ibat *i*'\ with a ►J* after "eo", was, according to
Paulus Grillandus, who twice witnessed it, a charm producing taci-
turnity and insensibility under torture ! Something, either this or
something else, being repeated by the prisoner in an inaudible voice.



General Not ings on Scot's Text. 573

a scroll containing these words and signs was found " in capite sub
scruffia scilicet inter crines" (Wier v, 12, §3).

P. 244. " Throwe." He might have added, " when you have got
it", before which time she would have been released, if not one way
yet by another.

P. 245. " Tye." Is like the "scarifie"; as one generally uses a
handkerchief.

P. 248. " That thou hereby . . patient as Job." This is to me one
of the oddest examples I have seen of the confusion of two or more
pronouns as to their subject ; for though the " thou" a line above
clearly refers to the worm, this one cannot refer to anything but to
the horse ; for after exorcising the worm in the name of the Trinity,
he surely would not exhort it to be as " patient as Job " and as " good
as St. John", particularly as the exorcism was made that the worm
might be expelled and die.

P. 251. " Remeeve." An excellent example of the devices had re-
course to by Elizabethan versifiers to obtain a rhyme.

P. 257. " Certeine name." I presume this caution is inserted lest
one hurt Tom instead of Harry.

" Each image must have in his hand." For the true read-
ing cf. "Extracts fi-om Wier". Scot must, I think, have trusted too
much to his memory.

"Domine Dominus", etc. Pss. 8. 27. 102. 109. Prayer Book

numbering.

P. 264. "Bladder." Clearly a press error for bladders.

"Ribbes and genitals." Conjoined, apparently, from a re-
membrance of the procreation of Eve, Genesis ii, 21, 22.

P. 265. "Sir John . . . pulpit." As the story was told of "as
honest a man . . . whereof mention was lately made", he was of the
Church of England ; see under p. 461 for "Sir". And since, I have
found that Bishop Hutchinson in his Dedication calls him Sir John
Orantham. Seemingly we thus have evidence of the dress in the
pulpit; but one unwilling to be convinced might retort that the very
mention of his sacerdotal dress is proof that he went into the pulpit
exceptionally attired, and not to preach, but to perform a quasi-sacer-
dotal office.

P. 266. "Hundred and eight." Here, from the "sayers of the
charm", the authority is, in all probability, the Vulg. Its 108 is our
109, Scot not having in this instance changed the numbering.

"Seachers." Probably "Sea[r]chers", as given in the second

edition, but it may have been a form of seekers, since seche^^seek.

" Horsse shoo." This superstition probably had its origin

from Stonehenge times and before, since the inner stones there,
apparently the more sacred portion, and, so far as one can now judge,
the corresponding part at Avebury, each form a horse-shoe. Sir H.
James first, I believe, noticed the true shape at Stonehenge, and I
afterwards independently observed it, both there and then at Avebury,
and connected it with this horse-shoe superstition in Tte Antiquary,
vol. ii, Oct. 1880.

'■^Aliciuin." Have not as yet found this.



574 General Noti7igs on Scot's Text.

P. 267. "Herbe betonica." " Stachys betonica", Plin., b. 25, c. 8.

"Pullein", etc. "Verbascum" ; " Thapsus", L., "bullock's

lungwort" (Kent). Tusser, like Scot, calls it "Longwort", a variant
of " Lungwort".

P. 268. "Baccar." "Nardum rusticum", or, according to Sprengel,
"Valeriana Celtica", L.; others "foxglove", or "asarabacca".

"Browze". Gives us the meaning of Bowze=boughs, it

being so spelt to accord, as was the custom, not only in rhyme but in
spelling.

"Vervain." "Verbena officinalis", L. (and other verbenas ?),

used, according to Park, "against poison, venom of beasts, and be-
witched drinks".

" Palma." Willows in England were used as the palm on

Palm Sunday ; sometimes the yew; but here I incline to think he
means Palma Christi, a flat-hand rooted orchis.

"Antirchmon." I suspect a misprint for "antirrhinum",

calf s snout, snap-dragon, A — . Linn. Pliny, b. 25, c. 8, says it is much
esteemed by enchanters,

" Lappoint." Minshen gives "Lapouin", as the French

for lapwing, but I have been unable to find this word. Wier v, 21 § 6,
says, as Scot, "Dicuntur & penna; upupa^ suffitEe, phantasmata
fugare", and the upupa, then as now, was taken to be the lapwing,
though Th. Cooper says, "Wherefore [from his crest as described]
it cannot be our lapwing ... it is rather ... an Houpe" [hoopoe],
which it is likely from the names, both being onomatopeiatic. The
daughter of the vicar of Oare, near Faversham, Kent, Miss K. P.
Woolrych, says that an old man, when young, heard lappoint as the
common name for the still-abounding lapwing.

P. 269. "Cleave an oken branch." One is tempted to think this bit
of folk-lore is a reminiscence of Druidical times.

P. 271. "Ps. Exaltabo.'" Ps. 245, Pr. B. vers.

P. 273. "Nameles finger." Wier, "innominatum". From this last,
which is not so much nameless as "unhappy", etc., I think the middle
finger is meant, "digitus impudicus", "famosus", "infamis", under
which latter epithet, cf. Persius, Sat. ii, for the reason. At 325 he
calls the middle finger the long, and at 326 the middle, at 329 the
longest finger.

P. 275. " Made room." Gave occasion or opportunity.

P. 284. '■^Finalie." This is in italics, the mark of a quotation, but
it is not from the Rhemish Test, of 1582, given as one of the books he
consulted, nor have I yet found from what Protestant version he took
it.

P. 289. "Eccle. I. & I." Probably a press error for i & 13, the
words being a remembrance of the sense of verses 13 and 17. It is
not Ecclus.

P. 294. "The corral." Can we see in this the origin of the almost
universal coral for children when teething.?

" Dinothera." Cannot find it.

"Aitites." Properly "Aetites", a stone said to be found in

the eagle's nest. Plin., b. 7, c. 3.



General Notings on Scof s Text. 575

P. 294. " Droonke as apes." An expression readily understood by
those who have watched the purposeless doings of apes and their
throwing themselves about.

"Amethysus." This occurs twice, but I know it not as a

variant of amethystus. "Corneolus." Various descriptions are given
of this by Pliny, Bartholome, Th. Cooper, Minshen, and Holyokes
Rider, but I presume (as given by Bailey) it is our cornelian.

P. 295. " Smarag." The emerald. "Mephis." Unknown to me.

P. 296. " Wherelay . . . concluded." It is improbable that this is,
as elsewhere, concealed irony. Much more probably Scot was not
free from a belief in the influences of the stars on the formation of
these stones, just as he believed in the influence of the moon in the
sowing of seeds, though he did not believe in astrology.

P. 300. "Academicall discourses." He refers to the disputations
held by students and candidates at the colleges, as these, of course,
naturally set forth the opinions of others.

P. 301. "Serpent abandon." Is this fabulous folk-lore or not?

P. 302. "Celondine, Chelidonius", cf. p. 293. It appears from
Dioscorides and Pliny, 25, 8, that the Chel. majus, L., is that spoken
of.

P. 303. " Reneweth bleeding." This variant, that it does so either
at " the presence of a deare friend or mortall enimie", and not merely
at that of the murderer, is worthy of note.

P. 304. " Our Princess doth." This, vouched for by one such as
Scot, shows the real piety and wisdom of Elizabeth as against the
scandals of the then times and the beliefs of after times.

P. 312. "Black children." I put this down either to looseness of
writing or to that want of discrimination (or colour blindness) which
led Elizabethans to speak of things as black, etc., which approached
that colour. "As black as a toad."

P. 314. "Two manner of todes." An example of the universal
belief that all insects, and some eels, serpents, and toads, were not
begotten, but produced by the action of the sun on inanimate matters,
in fact by spontaneous generation. Even the generation of man was
held to require the co-operation of the sun.

"Of the fat of a man . . . lice." He means, I presume, of

fat beneath the skin of a living person, a belief apparently confirmed
by the death of persons from lice ; for Bartholome, Batman's alias
Trevisa's translation, says, 1. 18, c. 88 : " Lice and nits gender in the
head or in the skinne"; and just before, they are engendered "of right
corrupt air & vapoures that sweate out betweene the skinne and the
flesh by pores."

P. 316. "Aqua composita." Not in Ovid's sense, but, I presume=
spirits of wine or rectified wine, etc., though I have not come across
the term elsewhere. I may add that Aqua was used=:Succus.

P. 319. "The cause being taken away." See note, p. 14.

P- 333- " Nether card." Scot evidently did not know " the pass";
possibly his age did not.

P. 338. " Gaggle of geese." The then correct term for a flock of
geese. Cf. The Bake of St. Albans^ at the end of " Hawking".

P- 339- "Send them to Pope." Unable to refer "them" to the
" horses" or to the " neighbors", I am forced to believe it an error
for " then".

" Unto the doore." This (.) should be (,) the " W " marking,

as usual, the beginning of (the purport of) his speech.

P. 342. " You meane to cut." He would say, "which you would
make believe to cut".

P. 367. " Extraordinary." Beyond the number of his ordinary
lemans.

P. 374. " Had I wist." A proverbial saying, at one time much in
fashion=had I known. Used here for an uncertainty which turned
out an ill certainty.

P. 386. " Goeth before." Takes precedency of.

" Be abroad." Cf. " Extracts from Wier II."

" If his cap be on his head." Cf. "Extracts from Wier II."

P. 390. '"''D unit que." When Dr. Fian was examined, James VI being

present, he, after the two torturings of the rope, and boots, confessed,
among other things, that he had bewitched a gentleman — a rival lover
— and "caused the sade Gentleman that once in xxiiii howers he fell
into a lunacie and madnes and so continued one hower together".
The gentleman was brought before the king, and went violently
mad for an hour, leaping so high that he touched the ceiling with his
head, and behaving so violently that the gentlemen present had to get
assistance and bind him hand and foot. Fian became penitent, and
renounced the devil ; next day said the devil had appeared and would
again have persuaded him, but he resisted him. However, he, Fian,
obtained the key of his prison door and fled. Re-captured, he denied
all his confession, saying that he had only made it through fear of
torture. Then " His nailes upon all his fingers were riven and pulled
out with ... a payre of pincers, and under everie naile there was
thrust in two needels over even up to the heads. [Here, I presume,
there is a hysteron proteron.] Then was he . . . convaied again to
the torment of the bootes wherein he continued a long time, and did
abide, so many blowes in them, that his legges were crusht and beaten
together as small as might bee, and the bones and flesh so brused,
that the bloud and inarrow spouted forth in great abundance, wherby
they were made unserviceable for ever," he still declaring that what
he had said before "was onely done and said for feare of paynes
which he had endured". He was strangled, and his body burnt,
according to law, towards the end of Jan. 1591. The italicising is
mine. Can anyone read this without a shudder, and without feelings of
indignation that will express themselves.''

The gentleman who went mad for an hour, and then said he had
been in a sound sleep, doubtless acted a part to confirm the tale of his
friend. This is confirmed by the fact that, violently as he behaved, he
seems to have hurt no one, not even himself

P. 406. "Common copulation." Used as "friendly conjunction" or
working together, in opposition to "carnal copulation", a phrase he
employs when necessary.

"To whome be honour." Is there an omission here of (as



General Notings on Scot's Text. 577

seems most likely) " In the name", etc., or are we to look liack as far
as "Tetragrammaton", etc., for antecedents? a course in which I can-
not myself believe.

P. 413. " My verie name." Cf. App. II, p. 60, § 22, though I know
not that this phrase is there explained, we may conjecture from it
that we have, while alive, spiritual "names after a Magical manner",
whatever that may mean.

P. 414. "ffalaur" (Diagram). If one were really wanted, a most
excellent example — whether we look to Scot's other uses of this word,
or to the names of the other three spirits in the diagram — that "fif " was
merely "F".

P. 416. " Ps. xxii and li." Prayer Book numbers and version.

P. 418. "Are written in this iDooke." It is clear, therefore, that
Scot took this experiment of Bealphares, and in all probability from
ch. 8 inclusive to this one, from some conjuring book, not improbably
T. R.'s.

P. 419. "; throno." Neither this nor its English equivalent is to
be found in any of these conjurations. In p. 417 we have, "which
conteinest the throne of heaven"; but unless the true translation be
" which are conteined in the throne of the heavens", this cannot be
" in throno". On the whole, I think that it refers to some conjuration
not copied by Scot, thus strengthening the supposition set forth under
Extracts from Wier II, and p. 418.

" Then say In thnnioP I feel by no means content with

the change of "then" to "thou". "And" may be an = "if", but I do
not remember an instance of Scot's use of "and" in this sense. Or
this "and" may be an accidental insertion by the printer, when after
^'•throno'" we might understand [adding] "that thou depart", etc.; and
this, I suspect, is the sense intended, whatever the emendation may
be.

P. 421. " Ch. XV." The making of the holy water is the Latin form
of that Englished from the Missal at p. 445. Hence, I presume, the
blessing of the salt is from the same.

P. 423. " In such a place N." There being no (,) N. seems here to
be used for any place, as it has been used for any man or spirit. So
"this N.", p. 424, refers to a bond or document. In pp. 425-6, where
"N." occurs four times, it can, so far as I can see, mean nothing else
but the place, the crystal or other matter, in which the spirit is to
appear. In p. 428, we have also "to your N.", explained just after-
wards as "into your christall stone, glasse", etc. And in p. 429, "anie
N." = gold, silver, etc. "N." was therefore a general indefinite, not
used, as now, for a man only ; still, its most likely etymon seems to
be the initial of "Nomen".

" On thy booke." In 424 we have " by the holie contents

in this booke", and " kisse the booke". From these, and from the
statements in the additions to the third edition that the conjuror is to
consecrate and take a Bible with him, I presume, that one is here
meant to be used.

P. 425. "Other bond." That, I presume, which follows on this
page.

p. 425. "Made a man for ever." I note this 1584 use of the
phrase.

P. 426. " I constreine the spirit of N." The after text might induce
one to suppose that "the"=thee, but the phrase is repeated seventeen
times in this chapter, and "thee spirit of N." not once, though we have
" the spirit of thee N." once, and " thou spirits of N." thrice. Our
Ehzabethan ancestors were apt thus to mingle up the second and
third persons.

P. 428. " Proove this." Try it ; put it to the proof.

P. 431. " (Blew miracles)." A friend suggests "trew"; but though
this is probably the sense, yet I hesitate to change the word. W. B.,
in Notes and (licries, fully explains this as '■'■blaues wuiider'\ an "amaz-
ing or wonderful wonder", the adjective being intensative, as is perhaps
"blue'' in the phrase, "once in a blue moon," z>., never.

P. 434. " Doctor Burc." The Burcot cozened into buying a
familiar from Feats, p. 522.

" He strake." Spirit-rapping, therefore, is older than this

century, though the manner was different.

P. 436. "Matins at midnight." The Franciscans solemnise matins
directly midnight is passed.

P. 437. "Officiall." The French name. Cf. Cotgrave and Du Cange,

P. 439. " To to abridge." A printer's repetition ; one being at the
end of a line, the second at the beginning of the next.

P. 441. '"'•Deus ill adjj(fori7i7n." Ps. Ixx. Prayer Book.

■ — "Excommunicate." 479. "Infatuate." The form originated

circa 1400, from " infatuatus", etc., before the verbs existed, and are
not examples of "ed" eliding or coalescing when the verb ends in "d"
or "t". This last, however, is found in Scot, and in a work at least
ten years older.

P. 442. " Vitas." See note 87. 458. Ditto.

P. 444. " Except in a plaie." Probably, therefore, had witnessed
Moralities, etc.

P. 446. " Increase." Error for " incense". Tobit viii, 5. (W. A.
Harrison.) Vulg. has no word for this in viii, 2 ; " Fumus", in vi, 8.
Genevan version, " perfume". Whether " incense" be Scot's own
word, or the rendering of some English version, I know not.

P. 459. " Sunne ... is 3966000." The nearest to this computation
that I can find is that of Archimedes, who made the sun's distance
1,160 times the earth's semi-diameter, that is, 3,985,760 miles. Scot,
however, must have taken some later computation, as he speaks of
the sun's " neerest" distance.

Note, a pound of good candles, such as were offered in

church, cost threepence.

P. 461. " Sir John"=the aforesaid priest. Cf. 265, 361, and "Sir

P. 466. " Kings bench." Note, still so called in 1583.

P. 467. "Most noble andvertuous personage." Probably Leicester.
Cf. close of letter.

P. 468. " Sir John Malborne," 1384. Hence an Englishman, and
not a German, was in all probability the first to raise his voice against
the cozenages of medieval witchcraft.

P. 476. " Wherein a Gods name." =:Wherein in God's name. No
oath, but he means to explain that the miracle consisted in his being
able to read the canonical scriptures written in God's name, or
inspired by Him, but not the fabulous Apocrypha.

" The good speed." See note, p. 24.
