## EOLAS NA RUAIDH

When this charm is applied, the point of a knife or a needle, or the tongue of
a brooch or of some other sharp instrument, is pointed threateningly at the
part affected. The part is then spat upon and crossed three times in the names
of the three Persons of the Trinity, whether it be the breast of a woman or the
udder of a cow. The legend says that Mary and Jesus were walking together
when Mary took rose (erysipelas) in her breast, and she said to Jesus :—

FAIC, a Mhic 's a Chriosda,  
Cioch do Mhathar air at,  
Thoir-sa fois dh' an chich,

## CHARM FOR ROSE
Behold, Son and Christ,  
The breast of Thy Mother swollen,  
Give Thou peace to the breast,  
Subdue Thou the swelling;  
Give Thou peace to the breast,  
Subdue Thou the swelling.

Behold it thyself, Queen,  
Since of thee the Son was born,  
Appease thou the breast,  
Subdue thou the swelling;  
Appease thou the breast,  
Subdue thou the swelling.  

See Thou it, Jesu,  
Since Thou art King of life,  
Appease Thou the breast,  
Subdue Thou the udder;  
Appease Thou the breast,  
Subdue Thou the udder.

I behold, said Christ, And I do as is meet,
I give ease to the breast,  
And rest to the udder;
I give ease to the breast,
And rest to the udder.

airidh,' well of the shieling fold, 'Tobar an deididh,' well of the toothache, 'Tobar na cnoidh,' well of the worm, and 'Tobar cnuimh fhiacail,' well of the tooth worm, from a beliefthat toothache iscaused by a worm in the tooth.
The general name of the well is 'Tobar Chuidh-airidh,' well of the shieling fold, to distinguish it from other healing wells throughout the Isles. The pilgrim suffering from toothache must not speak, nor eat, nor drink, after beginning the pilgrimage, till after three draughts of the well of Cuidh-airidh are drunk in name of God, and in name of Christ, and in name of Spirit.
Some persons profess to derive no relief, some profess to derive partial relief, and some profess to derive complete relief from toothache after drinking the water of the well of Cuidh-airidh.

While loudly calling to the jaundice demon to depart, the expert exorcist threw the red- hot share into the tub of water, adding to the already abundant noise in the room. Againsttheremonstrancesofthefather,whosaidthatAngusknewwhat he was about, the mother and sisters burst open the door, calling on Mary Mother to rescue the maltreated girl, and on Calumcille to redress her wrongs.
'Whether the cure was due to her simple faith in the exorcist or to the shock to her nervous system I do not know,' continued the narrator, 'but in a few days thegirlwasupandabout.

'Fath-fith ' and 'fith-fath ' are interchangeable terms and indiscriminately used. They are applied to the occult power which rendered a person invisible to mortal eyes andwhichtransformedoneobjectintoanother.

The'fith-fath'wasespeciallyserviceabletohunters,warriors, and travellers, rendering them invisible or unrecognisable to enemies and to animals.
Fionn had a fairy sweetheart, a daughter of the people of the mounds, but Fionn forsook her and married a daughter of the sons of men. The fairy was angry at the slight put upon her, and she placed the wife of Fionn under the 'fith- fath'spellintheformofahindofthehill. ThewifeofFionnboreasoninthe

Themotherpossessedsomuch of the nature of the hind that she licked the temple of the child when he was born, but she possessed so much of the nature of the woman that she only gave one lick. But hair like the hair of a fawn grew on the part of the temple of the child which thetongueofthehind-motherhadtouched. Andbecauseofthispatchoffawn's haironhistemplethechildwascalled'Oisein,'thefawn.

As he walked along he saw a timid hind browsinginagreencorriebeforehim. AndOssianthoughttohimselfthathe

ButthespiritofthehuntwasstronguponOssian,andthebloodofthe hunterwashotinhisveins,andhedrewhisspeartothrowitatthehind. The hind turned and looked at Ossian and gazed upon him with her full wistful grey eyes, more lovely and alluring than the blue eyes of love. 'Do not hurt me, Ossian,' said the hind; 'I am thy mother under the "fith-fath," in the form of a hindabroadandintheformofawomanathome. Thouarthungryandthirsty and weary.

In his Leabhar Na Feinne Iain Campbell of Islay says that he had received fourteen versions of this song of Ossian. Six of these had been sent to him by the present writer. One of these versions was obtained from Oirig Nic Iain — Effric or Effie Mac Iain— lineally descended, she said, from Alexander Mac
Iain, chief of the massacred Macdonalds of Glencoe.

After the failure of Dundee in 1689 Clanranald lived in France for several years. There he made the acquaintance of Penelope, daughter of Colonel Mackenzie, governor of Tangiers under Charles 11. Clanranald married Penelope Mackenzie and broughtherhome. HealsobroughtaFrencharchitect,Frenchmasons,andFrench freestonetobuildanewhouseatOrmacleit. Thehousetooksevenyearsinbuilding andwasoccupiedforsevenyears. OnthenightofthebattleofSherifTmuir,whenits owner was killed, the house was burnt to the ground through the kitchen chimney takingfire. SomedayspreviouslyLadyClanranaldhadtoldsomegueststhatshe had had a vision that her eyes melted away in scalding water and that her heart burned up like a live coal, and she feared some dire double disaster was to befall her.
'Tota mhor Ormacleit '— the great ruins of Ormacleit, stand high and pic turesque on the monotonous far-reaching machairs of the Atlantic side of South Uist. Thegablesarehigh-pointed,andthewingsbeingatrightanglestothemain building, the ruins show to admirable advantage in the long, level landscape.
The freestone forming the corners, doors, and windows is of peculiar hardness, andofabluetint.
The farm of Ormacleit had been tenanted during many years by Mr. John Maclellan, whose wife was Miss Penelope Macdonald, a kinswoman of Flora Mac donaldandofherchiefClanranald.

I will place the charm of the lasting life Upon your cattle active, broad, and full,
The knoll upon which the herds shall lie down,
That they may risefrom itwhole and well.

U p with activity and following,
Without envy, without malice, without ill-will, Without small eye, without large eye,
Without the five eyes of neglect.
I will suck this, the sucking of envious vein
O n the head of the house, and the townland families, That every evil trait, and every evil tendency
Inherent in you shall cleave to them.
If tongue cursed you, A heartblessedyou; If eye blighted you, A wish prospered you.

To their female sheep and to their male calves,
For the nine and the nine score years.

The results of the evil eye appear in yawning and vomiting and in a general disturbance of the system. The countenance assumes an appearance grim, grue some, and repulsive— 'greann, greisne, grannda.'
This formula for removing the effects of the evil eye is handed down from male to female, from female to male, and is efficacious only when thus transmitted. Before pronouncing it over the particular case of sickness, the operator proceeds to a stream, where the living and the dead alike pass, and lifts water, in name of the Holy Trinity, into a wooden ladle. In no case is the ladle of metal. On returning, a wife's gold ring, a piece of gold, of silver, and of copper, are put in the ladle.

CUNNTAS AN T-SLEAMHNAIN [154]
The exorcism of the stye is variously called 'Cunntas an t-Sleamhnain '— Count ing of the Stye, 'Kolas an t-Sleamhnain '— Exorcism of the Stye, and 'Eoir an t-Sleamhnain '— Charm of the Stye.
When making the charm the exorcist holds some sharp-pointed instru ment, preferably a nail, or the tongue of a brooch or buckle, between the thumbandforefingeroftherighthand. Witheachquestiontheoperatormakes afeintwiththeinstrumentatthestye,goingperilouslyneartheeye. The sensation caused by the thrusting is extremely painful to the sufferer and even to the observer.
The reciter assured the writer that a cure immediately follows the operation. Possibly the thrusting acts upon the nervous system of the patient.
Ordinarily the exorcist omits mentioning the word 'sleamhnan 'after the first two times, abbreviating thus :—
'Cum antainigadhaanseo Why camethetwohere Gunatrianseo?' Withoutthethreehere?

Maoldomhnuich is one of the many personal names originating in the Celtic Church, now rare elsewhere, but still current in the Western Isles. Some of these names with their meanings are interesting. Maoldomhnuich means 'the tonsured of the Lord,' Maolciaran 'the tonsured of Ciaran,' Maolpadruig 'the ton sured of Patrick,' Maolcalum 'the tonsured of Columba,' Maolmicheil 'the tonsured of Michael,' Maolbride 'the tonsured of Bride,' Maolmoire 'the tonsured of Mary.'

THE CHARM OF THE FIGWORT
theBeatonsofIslay. TheyinturnweredescendedfromtheBeatonsofMull,who are said to have come down from Beatan, the medical missionary of the Columban Church of Iona. These Beatons produced many eminent men, among them James Beaton, Archbishop of Glasgow, and his still greater nephew David, the Cardinal Archbishop of St. Andrews, and, through the Barons Livingstone of Bachuill, Lismore, David Livingstone, physician, missionary, traveller and explorer. Mary Beaton, mentioned in the song of the Queen's Four Maries, was also of these Beatons :—
'Last night there were four Maries, This night there shall be but three :
There was Marie Beaton and Marie Seaton And Marie Carmichael and me.'
The people of Mull say that this Mary Beaton was of the Mull family, but the distinguished scholar, the late Hector Maclean, and other Islay men, claimed that shewasoftheIslayBeatons. TheBeatonswerehereditary'leighean,'physicians, to the Lords of the Isles and to other great insular and mainland chiefs. They were also physicians to the Kings of Scotland, whom they visited periodically. Payments for some of these visits are recorded in the Exchequer Rolls.
TheBeatonsleftmanymss.onmedicineandonmedicinalplants. Someofthese are in the Advocates' Library, some are in private possession, and many are known to have been lost. Some of the most beautiful sculptured stones in Iona, Mull, Islay, and elsewhere, are over the tombs of Beatons.
Several of the Beatons of Mull and Islay went to Paris and other Continental citiestocompletetheirmedicalandtheologicalstudies. Someoftheseremained abroad and rose to positions of distinction. The name is still to be met with in
FranceintheFrenchformofBethune. OneoftheBeatonsonreturningtoScot land retained that form of the name. H e settled in Fife. A descendant of his settled in Skye as leech to Macleod of Macleod, founding the Skye branch of the family. Oneofthisfamilywasknownas'FearacharLeigh,''FearacharLighiche,' Farquhar the physician. He held the small estate of Husabost, near the mouth of Dunvegan Loch, for his services. He had a medical ms. valued at sixty milch cows ; and so careful was he of this manuscript, that when he himself came up to Dunvegan by boat he sent a trusted man-servant on horseback round by land withthemanuscript. JohnBeaton,theshepherdofUist,wasdescendedfrom this 'Fearachar Leigh.'
John Beaton was too old and too rheumatic to move from home, but he described the 'torranan,' its flower, leaf, stalk, and root, and its situation in Benmore, to his son and the writer, with marvellous fulness and accuracy, though he had not been

Thiswasin1877. JohnBeatondiedin1881,aged92,oneofnature'sscientists andofnature'sgentlemen. In1896hisson,Fearachar,sentmethetwoplants fromBenmoreinSouthUist. OneofthemIgavetoProfessorBayleyBalfourof theUniversityofEdinburgh,whokindlyidentifiedtheplantforme.
The following tradition is current in Uist :— The Pope sent Torranan to teach thepeopleofIrelandthewayofsalvation. ButthepeopleofIrelandwouldnot receiveTorranan,whomtheybeatandmaltreatedinvariousways. Torrananprayed toGodtodeliverhimfromtheIrish,andshookthedustofIrelandoffhisfeet. He betook himself to his coracle and turned it sun-wise, in name of God, and in name of Christ, and in name of Spirit, praying the 'Teora Naomh,' Holy Three, to send him when and where and whichever way they listed and had work for him to do— but not again to Ireland. The man was driven about hither and thither on the wildwavesinhisfrailcoraclenooneknowshowlongorhowfar. ButanEyewas on his prow, and a Hand was on his helm, and the tide, and the wind, and the waves combined to take him into the little creek of Cailigeo in Benbecula.
TheislandofBenbeculaissituatedbetweentheislandsofSouthUistandNorth Uist, its axis being at right angles to the axes of these islands— one end on the Minch,theotherontheAtlantic. Itisfordableonbothsideswhenthetideis out, hence the Gaelic name 'Beinn-nam-faoghla'— ben of the fords. The hill indicated in the name is near the centre of the island and nearly in a direct line betweenthefords. Itiscalled'Ruaidhbhal,''Ruaival'—redhill,fromtheGaelic 'ruadh'—red,andtheNorse'fell'—ahill. RuaivalistheonlyhillinBenbecula. Itiscone-shaped,flatandlevelonthetop,and409feetinheight. Thesloping sides are flushed with heather, while the flat summit is green and grassy. The summit commands an extraordinary view of fords and channels, islands, peninsulas and mainlands, seas and lakes, and of moors and machairs broken up and dotted over in the most marvellous manner with shallow pools, tarns, and lakes scattered broad castbeyondcount,beyondnumber. Probablytheworlddoesnotcontainanything more disorderly than the distribution of land and water in and around Benbecula.
When Torranan was ascending the round red hill of Ruaival to survey his surroundings and to ascertain his whereabouts, his breast was sore from thirst, for hehadhadnowatertodrinksinceleavingIreland. AudTorrananprayedtoGod forwatertoquench his thirst,and lo!the red rockbefore him rentasunder,and fromthefissureaclearrillofcoldwaterissued. Torrananthuspre-experienced thetruthofGoethe'swords:—
'At his appointed time revolving,
The sun these shades of night dispels,
The rock, its rugged breast dissolving, Gives up to earth its hidden wells.'

 INCANTATIONS 81
The water was fair to see and pleasing to taste, and Torranan drank his 'seachd sath '— seven satiations, and he blessed the rill from the rent rock and called it 'Gamhnach'—farrowcow. 'AgusghuidhTorrananairDiamornandulnach d'reathadh a Ghamhnach gu brath an diosg '— 'And Torranan beseeched the great Godoftheelementsthatthe"Gamhnach"mightnevergodry.' Andeversince thenallpilgrimswhogotothe'Gamhnach'anddrinkoftherillgiveachoicegreen leaf to the 'farrow cow 'in memory of its refreshing drink to the holy man who came to teach the people of 'Innis Cat '— Isle of the Caty— the way of salvation.
The man rejected of the people of Ireland became the accepted missionary of thepeopleofUist. Hewishedtobuildhisprayer-houseon'CnocFeannaig,'the knoll of the hooded crow, within sight and hearing of the wild waves of Cailigeo wherehehadbeendrivenashorefromhisperilousvoyage.

ThenTorrananbuilthisprayer-houseonthelittleisland within hearing but not within seeing of the green seas and white waves of Cailigeo. And when the house was made Torranan dedicated the labour of his hands and the subjectofhisprayerstoGod and toColumba.

The Columbanchurchesarebelievedtohavebeenusuallyconstructedofwattles. But there were no wattles nor wood of any kind in Uist so late as Columba's time. Consequently, in this and similar situations the Columban brethren and followers
had to depart from their usual practice, and build of stone.
The lake containing the peninsula on which Torranan built his prayer-house,
dedicatedtoColumba,iscalled'LochChaluim-chille'—Columba'sLoch. Itonly covers an area of some few acres and is of no great depth. Cairns and crosses studdedthemanyknollsandhillockssurroundingthelake.

Torranan is represented on the West in the island of 'Tarransey,' Tarran's island. InthissmallrockyglaciatedislandoftheAtlanticthereweretwosmall churches, of which nothing now remains but the foundations, with a small burying- ground attached to each. The churches are beautifully situated on the sea-shore near one another, and look across to the ice-rounded mountains of Harris and Uist, while in the far-away blue distance are seen the serrated calcined hills of Skye. Oneofthesesimplechurcheswithitsburying-groundwasdedicatedtoSaintTarran and called 'Teampull Tharrain '— the Temple of Tarran, and 'Cladh Tharrain '— the burial-place of Tarran. The other church and burying-ground were dedicated to Saint Ce, or Keith, and were called 'Teampull Che '— the Temple of Ce, and 'Cladh Che '— the burial-place of Ce. The temple and burying-ground of Tarran were exclusively for the use of women, while the temple and burying-ground of Ce were exclusivelyfortheuseofmen. Thisrulecouldnotbeviolatedwithimpunity. If the body of a man were buried in St. Tarran's, or the body of a woman in St. Ce's, the guardian spirits of the temples and burying-grounds thrust forth the obtruded corpseduringthenight,anditwasfoundinthemorninglyingstiffandstarkabove- ground.

Palladius is the name usually assigned to the missionary sent by the Pope to the Irish and rejected by them. Skene thinks that Ternan was a disciple of Palladius, with whom he is confounded.

The shamrock of luck must be found, like many of the other propitious plants, 'gun sireadh, gun iarraidh'— without searching, without seeking. When thus discovered the lucky shamrock is warmly cherished and preserved as an invincible talisman.
'Seamarag nam buadh,' shamrock of luck, is often lovingly called 'seamarag nam buadh agus nam beannachd,' shamrock of luck and of blessing.

Immediately after birth the foal throws up a pale soft substance resembling a sponge or the seed-cells of the cod. This sponge-like substance coughed up by the newly-born foal is variously called 'deocan, deocadan, deocardan.' The people bury this in the ground, believing that the lucky shamrock grows from it as the nettles grow from human remains, whether buried in the pure shelly sand on the sea-shore or in the pure peat moss on the mountain-side.

The 'mothan 'isone of the most prized plants in the occult science of the people. It is used in promoting and conserving the happiness of the people, in securing love, in ensuring life, in bringing good, and in warding away evil.
When the 'mothan ' is used as a love-philtre, the woman who gives it goes upon her left knee and plucks nine roots of the plant and knots them together, formingthemintoa'cuach'—ring. Thewomanplacestheringinthemouthof thegirlforwhom itismade,innameoftheKingofthesun,andofthemoon,and ofthestars,andinnameoftheHolyThree. When thegirlmeetsherlover,or a man whom she loves and whose love she desires to secure, she puts the ring in hermouth. And shouldthemankissthegirlwhilethe'mothan'isinhermouth he becomes henceforth her bondsman, bound to her everlastingly in cords infinitely finer than the gossamer net of the spider, and infinitely stronger than the adamant chain of the giant.
The 'mothan' is placed under parturient women to ensure delivery, and it is carried by wayfarers to safeguard them on their journeys. It is sewn by women in their bodice, and by men in their vest under the
left arm.
An old woman in Benbecula said:— 'Thug mi am mothan

I remembered Bacon and was silent.
To drink the milk of an animal that ate the 'mothan' ensures immunity from harm. If a man makes a miraculous escape it is said of him, 'Dh' ol e bainne na bo ba a dh' ith am mothan '— 'He drank the milk of the guileless cow that ate the " mothan." '

— all save the aspen alone— bowed their heads in reverence to the King of glory passing by on the way to Calvary ; and the thorn-tree because of its prickly pride in having been made into a crown for the King of kings.

Hence the proverb:— 'Isefearnabofeintheid'sanfheithantos'— Itistheman ofthecow himself who shall go into the ditch first. The practice of throwing down the wand and repeating the hymn gave rise to a proverb among the more sceptical of the people :— 'Cha dean thu feith Mhoire orm-s' idir a mhicean '— Thou wilt not m a k e a ' v e i n o f M a r y ' u p o n m e a t all, s o n n i e .

'Place thine hand in the water-stoup below the dresser and see if thy butter be there,' said the tailor. And with that the woman placed her hand in the water-stoup as directed, and three successive times, and each time brought up a large lump of butter as fresh and fair and fragrant as the beauteous butter-cups in their prime. The clever tailor had counteracted the machinations of the greedy neighbour woman by placing the live cinders in the water-stoup.

FRITH MHOIRE [194]
The 'frith,' augury, was a species of divination enabling the 'frithir,' augurer, to see intotheunseen. Thisdivinationwasmadetoascertainthepositionandcondition of the absent and the lost, and was applied to man and beast. The augury was made on the first Monday of the quarter and immediately before sunrise. The augurer, fasting, and with bare feet, bare head, and closed eyes, went to the door
stepandplacedahandoneachjamb. Mentallybeseechingthe God of the unseen to show him his quest and to grant him his augury, the augurer opened his eyes and looked steadfastly straight in front of him. From the nature and position of the objects within his sight, he drew his conclusions.

AUGURY OF MARY
Many men in the Highlands and Islands were famed augurers, and many stories, realistic, romantic, and extremely curious, are still told of their divinations.
The people say that the Virgin made an augury when Christ was missing, and that it was by means of this augury that Mary and Joseph ascertained that Christ was in the Temple disputing with the doctors. Hence this divination is called 'frith Mhoire,'— the augury of Mary ; and 'frithireachd Mhoire,'— the auguration of Mary.
The'frith'oftheCeltisakintothe'frett'oftheNorseman. Probablythe surnames Freer, Frere, are modifications of 'frithir,' augurer. Progenitors of persons bearing this name were astrologers to the kings of Scotland.
God over me, God under me, God before me, God behind me, I on Thy path, O God,
Thou, O God, in m y steps.

The swan is a favourite bird and of good omen. To hear it in the morning fasting— especially on a Tuesday morning— is much to be desired. To see seven, or a multiple of seven, swans on the wing ensures peace and prosperity for seven, or a multiple of seven years.
In windy, snowy, or wet weather swans fly low, but in calm, bright, or frosty weather they fly high ; but even when the birds are only specks in the distant blue lift above, their soft, silvery, flute-like notes penetrate to earth below.
Swans are said to be ill-used religious ladies under enchantment, driven from their homes and forced to wander, and to dwell where most kindly treated and

A woman found a wounded swan on a frozen lake near her house, and took it home, where she set the broken wing, dressed the bleeding feet, and fed the starving bird with lintseed and water. The woman had an ailing child, and as the wounds of the swan healed the health of the child improved, and the woman believed that her treatment of the swan caused the recovery of her child, and she rejoiced accordingly and composed the following lullaby to her restored child:—

These houses were attached to Iona, and were ruled and occupied bymembersofthe6rstfamiliesoftheWesternIsles. Probablytheirinsularity secured them from dissolution at the time of the Reformation, for these com munities lingered long after the Reformation, and ceased to exist simply through natural decay.
It is said that two nuns had been visiting a sick woman. When returning home from the moorland to the townland, they heard the shrill voice of a child and the soft voice of a woman. The nuns groped their way down the rugged rocks, and there found a woman soothing a child in her arms. They were the only two saved from a wreck— the two frailest in the ship.

The famous battle of Clontarf was fought on Good Friday, April 23rd, 1014. The Irish were led by their celebrated warrior-king, Brian Boroimhe, monarch of allIreland,andtheDanesbytheirCelto-Danishprince,EarlSigurd. Therewas indescribable havoc on both sides. The slaughter, as seen, from the walls of Dublin,isdescribedasresemblingtheworkofmadreapersinafieldofcorn. Earl Sigurd fell. This was foretold him by his mother, Audna, daughter of Carroll, King of Ireland, when she gave him the 'Raven Banner of Battle 'at Skidda-myre, now Skidden, in Caithness. Audna told Sigurd that the Raven Banner would alwaysbringvictorytotheowner,butdeathtothebearer. Atthebattleof Clontarfevery man who took up the Raven Banner fell. At last no one would takeitup.

The victorious Irish slaughtered the defeated Danes with all the concentrated hate of three centuries of cruel wrong. The fall of Earl Sigurd was made known to his friends in the North through the fore-knowledge of the Valkymar, the twelve weird sisters of Northern Mythology, ofwhom Graysingsinhis'FatalSisters.'

THE KERTCH
The song from which this lastverse isquoted had curious wanderings and narrow escapes— from Lochaber to Lahore, from Lahore to Lochalsh, and from Lochalsh to Skye and Uist. It was taken down at Howmore, South Uist, from Peggie Macaulay, better known as Peggie Robertson and 'Peigi Sgiathanach'— Skye Peggie. She came from 'Sleibhte riabhach nam ban boidheach,'— brindled Sleat of the beautiful women, and well upheld the reputation of her native place, for she was a tall, straight, comely brunette, with beautiful brown eyes and hair 'like raven's plumage, smoothed on snow.' She had accompanied her master and mistress, Captain and Mrs. Macdonald, Knock, Skye, on a visit to Sir John Macrae, Airdantouil, Lochalsh. Sir John was famed for his symmetry, bravery, and accomplishments. HeinheritedthemusicaltalentsoftheMacleodsofRararsey, and could play a phenomenal number of musical instruments. He was wont to say that there was no music for the house equal to Highland music, nor instrument forthefieldequaltotheHighlandbagpipe. SirJohnhadbeenmilitaryattache to his cousin, the Marquis of Hastings, when he was Governor-General of India. From Sir John Macrae, Peggie Macaulay heard the words of this song and an accountofhowhegotthem. SirJohnsaidthatwheninIndiahewassentwith despatchestoadistantfort. Ashewasnearingthegateundercoverofnight,he was surprised to hear a Gaelic song once heard in childhood and often sought since. W h e n he reined in his horse to listen, the sentry stopped his song and challenged. TheanswerwasgiveninGaelic,andthesentrywassurprisedinhisturn. Macrae was just in time to rouse the Governor from his fancied security and to lead the garrison to repel an attack, in which the singer Eoghan Cameron fell after killing seven sepoys single-handed.
Sir John Macrae died soon after Peggie Macaulay heard him singing the song, and she died soon after the song was taken down from her dictation by the present writer. Sir John Macrae called this song, 'treas taladh na h-Alba,' — the third lullaby of Alban, and as sung by bright Peggie Robertson it merited praise.
A thousand hails to thee beneath thy kertch, During thy course mayest thou be whole, Strength and days be thine in peace,
Thy paradise with thy means increase.

In beginning thy course, seek thou the God of life, Fear not but H e will rightly rule

Asthenamesindicate,theplacesstandhigh. Dun Aingil in Lochaber is situated on the side of a mountain 686 feet above the sea,andisalsocalled'CladhChoireil,'St.Cyril'sBurial-ground. Thisisthe only 'aingil'knoll known to me used as a place of burial, though at Muckairn a 'Cnoc Aingil' or 'Tulach Aingil' adjoins the burying-ground, 105 feet above sea level, called by some 'Cladh Choireil,' Cyril's Burial-ground, and by others 'Cladh Easbuig Earail,' Bishop Harold's Burial-ground. Harold was the first bishop of the see of Argyll and the Isles, disjoined from that of Dunkeld in 1200.
'CnocAingil'inIonaisagreenknollonasandyplain. Inhis'Lifeof Columba,' Adamnan says that angels were wont to converse with Columba on this knoll, and that during drought the brethren carried the tunic of the saint round the knoll singing psalms and repeating prayers the while, whereupon copious rainfell. PennantmentionsthatthepeopleofIonarodesunwiseround*Cnoc Aingil 'on St. Michael's Day.
Probably these knolls were places of sun-worship and fire-worship, which were current in the West as they are in the East.

Beoir, spruce, spruce beer. Spruce beer is obtained from the spruce tree, as whisky was obtained from the birch tree, whence 'uisge beithe,' birch water, corrupted 'uisge beatha,' life water.
Spruce was much used in olden times, and is often mentioned in the old songs and sayings of the people.
'Beoir us brailis b'eol domh agad, Spruce and wort I know were thine, Mil us bainno buaile.' Honey and milk ofcattle-fold.

The nearest term to this known to me is 'bith-braonach,' dewy-world, a term which occurs in a lament composed by a maiden on her lover slain by her three brothers. The song is very old and very beautiful. It was sung to a weird old air by a girl in the island of Miunghlaidh (Mingalay), Barra, in August
1868. As the girl rehearsed the history and sang the song her fine features glowed with subdued animation and sympathy for the distressed maiden.

The late J. G. Campbell, minister of Tiree, held that a race similar to the Lapps lived in Scotland about the glacial period.
In 1869 the writer opened an underground house at Valacuidh, North Uist. In 1871 the late Iain F. Campbell of Islay accompanied him to see it. Mr. Campbell was familiar with I^apps and Lapp dwellings, and he said that this undergroundstructurewasentirelysimilartothoseoftheLapps. Fragments of horns, bones, shells, and other debris found in the house were submitted to Sir Richard Owen, who discovered bits of reindeer horns and bones among them.

Brianain,Breannan,Brendan. St.Brendanwasavoyagergoinglongjourneyswest andnorthinhismissionaryzeal. AccordingtoMatthewArnold'sshortpoemon St. Brendan, the Saint saw Judas Iscariot sitting on an iceberg in the far north. O n inquiry he found that on account of his having given his cloak to a beggar, Judas was allowed an hour's respite from burning pain, and selected an iceberg as likely to be the most comfortable place.
Malcolm Maclean, smith, Ceanntangval, Barra, said that Brendan asked to be buried beside his beloved 'anam-chara,' soul friend, Moluag in Lismore, andthatthiswasdone. MalcolmMaclean,whowasamanofquietwit,natural intelligence, and independence of mind, told m e the following story :—
A man called 'Domhull Dubh,' sometimes 'Domhull Dubh Mor,' dwelt at Baile-na-creige, near St. Brendan's church and burial-place in Barra.
Domhull Dubh had opinions of his own about Saints and Saints' Days, in consequence of which he and the priest of St. Brendan had occasional rubs, sometimesborderingonanger. Themanwasneighbourlyandindustrious,but some said sceptical and irreligious, barely observing the Sunday, and hardly even the Feast Day.
On the day of the holy Brendan, when others becomingly went to morning mass, Domhull Dubh went away to plough. He chose a hollow out of sight, where he thought he might work unseen and unmolested of man, or of woman,

or of tell-tale child, not thinking that the eye of Brendan would see him, nor that the wrath of Brendan would be upon him for disturbing his rest and breaking his day.
No sooner had Domhull Dubh called his horses to go on than a 'ceo drao,' magic mist, came down, dark as the shroud of death, hiding the horses before him,andthe'crom-nan-gad,'singleplough,inhishand. Feelingthathehad offended the Saint, he called on his name :—
'A Bhrianain ! a Bhrianain ! Brendan ! O Brendan ! Togdhiomanceo.' Liftoffmethemist.
The fog lifted, but instead of his stout, steady, short-eared, long-maned, long- tailed garrons, he had but slim, frail, long-eared, short-maned, short-tailed asses before him in the furrow, and instead of his plough he had now but his wife's distaff in his hand, while he himself had dwindled down to a mere manikinnobiggerthanadwarf.

Immediatelythemagicmist came down, rendering the light around him as black as the sea around the cuttle-fish, hiding the asses in front, and the distaff in his hand. Again he called on the Saint :—
'A Bhrianain!aBhrianain!
A dheoin Dhia 'sa mhiann dhaoine, Tog dhiom an ceo.'
Brendan!O Brendan!
With God's will and men's wish, Liftfrom me the fog.
The fog cleared away, but instead of the asses and the distaff he had now long- eared, maneless, tailless coneys in front of him, and his wife's spindle in his hand,whilehehimselfwasnobiggerthanafairymanoftheknoll. Domhull Dubh marvelled much at the transformation, and was sorely perplexed what to do. He,however,beganagaintoplough,butagainthemagicmistdescended. Being now convinced that he had offended the Saint, he earnestly called upon hisnameincontritionofheart:—
'ABhrianain!aBhrianain!

Domhull Dubh Mor having shown repentance of soul and a spirit of prayer, the fog lifted up, and instead of the coneys and the spindle he had now his own sturdy garrons in front of him and his own good plough in his hand, and he himself, from being as small as a fairy man of the knoll, was become himself again.

him, saying that it was futile for a sinner to contend against a saint, and that he deserved all that had come upon him, and more, for disturbing the rest of the blessed Brendan, and breaking his holy day. But there was one who did not upbraid Domhull Dubh Mor, but who cleaved to him the more closely t h e m o r e h e w a s r e v i l e d , a n d w h o s a n g i n h e r h e a r t i f n o t w i t h h e r v o i c e :—

The comely young wife of Domhull Dubh ran to the priest, and besought him for the sake of the Holy Mother, the Virgin of sorrows, to come and sprinkle 'the water' on Domhull, and remove from him the ban of Brendan.
'Let Domhull Dubh Mor revel in his agony,' said the priest, 'till he showsbyhisgooddeedscontritionforhisevilways.' Butthegoodpriestcame notwithstanding, and, after administering a rebuke to Domhull Dubh, sprinkled on him the water of peace, and bade him go and give alms to the poor and the needy made in the image of God, and sin no more.

The affrighted girl, trembling like the leaf of the aspen tree, looked in her hand, and lo ! the erstwhile pellets of glittering gold were become filth, and in disgust she threw them away.

It was customary to place a wax candle, a gold coin, a hammer, and a pair of scales with the body in the grave. The candle was to light the pilgrim 'thar abhuinn dubh a bhais,' across the black river of death ; the coin to pay 'duais a asgair,' the services of the ferryman ; the hammer, 'chon bualadh dorus nam flathas,' to knock at the door of heaven; and the scales, 'chon cothromachadh an anama,' to weigh the soul.
Some years ago the Atlantic waves exposed to view a grave in Cladh Aruinn, an ancient burial-plot in the small island of Keilligrey, in the Sound of Harris. The grave contained a large skeleton, a small hammer, and a pair of small scales.
Candlesticks have also been found in graves.
When the news reached the people of Lismore that their beloved St. Moluag was dead, twenty-four of the strongest men of the island travelled to Ardclach and brought home the body and buried it beneath the altar of his churchinthecentreofthechurchyard. Aboutthecloseoflastcentury,while openingagraveaboutthisplace,atripodgoldcandlestickwasfound. Calcined bones, stones, and wood came up in the debris where the tripod was discovered. The church, crowded with people, had been burned by the Norsemen. The tripod may have formed part of the altar furnishing of the church, or it may havebeenburiedwithSt.Moluag.

Caithris, wake, watch, harass ; the labour required of a crofter holding under a tacksman.
Throughout the Highlands and Islands the chiefs and proprietors generally rented out large tracts of land to relatives, connections, and friends. These were called 'fir gabhail,' gavelkind men, 'fir baile,' townland men, tacksmen, in Ireland middlemen. The tacksmen retained the best land in their own immediate possession, sub-letting the remainder to tenants of varying degrees at exorbitant rents. Besides exacting high rents, the tacksman exacted labour— so many days from each crofter throughout the year. It would not
be profitable, were it possible, to describe these things here. The reader interested can find them in Travels in the Western Isles, by the Rev. John Lane Buchanan, and other works.
The lot of the crofter holding under the proprietor might be hard enough, butthatofthecrofterholdingunderthetacksmanwasinfinitelyharder. This wrungfromtheheartsofthepeoplemanysayings,as,'Gilleghilleismeasana'n diobhal '— The servant of the servant is worse than the devil.

Butthelung-powerofevenaSt.Kilda man hasitslimits,and thesehaving at length been reached, the confusion of voices subsides, and the people peace ably and promptly decide their action for the day, hastily go in to breakfast, and leisurely come out to work.
An observer would think, not unreasonably, that these people were quarrel someandill-tempered;quitethereverse,however. Themembersofthis simple, lovable little community are most kind and attached one to the other, the joy of one, or the grief of another, being the joy or the grief of all.

Cuartachadh, circuiting, encompassing, surrounding, making a sanctuary. 'Cuar- tachadh a chlaidh,' circuiting the burying-ground ; 'cuartachadh cladh nan athraichean,' circuiting the burying-ground of the fathers. This is done on St. Michael's day, and is probably a remnant of ancestor-worship, while 'dol deiseil a chlaidh,' going sunwise round the burial-ground, represents sun- worship. 'Cuartachadh teaghlaich,' encompassing the family. This is the
term used for family worship in the counties of Ross, Cromarty, Sutherland, and Caithness. 'Cuartachadh baile,' circuiting the townland. Being tenants at will,and liable to eviction, the crofters erected no fences round their fields; consequently when the crops were in the ground they had to guard them by night and by day from their own and their neighbours' herds. During the day the townland herdsman tends the animals and keeps them from the crops, butbynightthetownlandispatrolledbyamanfromeachoftwofamiliestaken in rotation. These men are called 'cuartaiche,' circuiters. If the townland be a large one this duty coming at long intervals is not much felt, but in a smalltownlandthenightwatchingbecomesoppressive. Incroftingtownlands adjoining deer forests, geese, duck, or other game resorts, the men patrol their crops all night to safeguard them, and kindle fires where incursions are most feared. Should damage result through the remissness of these two men, the two families represented are responsible and make reparation. The damage doneisappraisedbymensetapartandswornforthepurpose.
The security of land tenure given by the recent Crofters Act is putting an end to the necessity for circuiting the townland crops, as already fences, houses, drains, and other land improvements Are rapidly progressing.

This sentiment is characteristic of the Celt, who is a man of the land primarily and a man of the sea secondarily— a landsman of choice and a seaman of necessity. Nevertheless, when the Celt does take to the sea, pro bablyheisunexcelledasaboatman,asamariner,orasanavigator. Itis computed that two-thirds of the seafaring men of the Clyde are Celts and of Celtic descent, and probably these will compare favourably with their class elsewhere. Animpressionprevailsinmanyplacesthattheislesmenofthe West are not boatmen equal to the coastmen of the East. That is not my experience,extendingoveralongperiodofcloseobservationofboth. Ofthe two the islander is the more daring, more active, and more expert boatman. This was many times acknowledged to me by East Coast men fishing on the West Coast.
The East Coast man is a fisherman by choice inherited through many generations and many centuries ; the West Coast man is a fisher from com pulsion, and recently when driven from the land. The sea of the West Coast is more tidal, more stormy, and more dangerous than that of the East Coast, and the natives do not take to it from choice. They have many sayings against it:— 'Is corrach gob an dubhan '— Unstable the point of the fish-hook.
'Is math an cobhair an t-iasg, Good is the help of the fishing, Ach isdon an sobhal an t-iasg.' But a bad barn isthe fishing.

Cu-gearr, short dog, wolf; from 'cu,' dog, and 'gearr,' short. Several names are applied to the wolf, as 'cu-faol,' 'faol-chu,' 'madadh-alla,' 'alla-mhadadh,' wild-dog ; 'cu-coille,' 'coille-chu,' wood dog ; 'madadh-mor,' 'mor-mhadadh,' big dog ; 'blad,' mouth ; 'bladair,' mouther.
In 1427, Parliament passed an Act calling upon all barons to exterminate the wolf. It was not, however, till 1743 that the wolf became extinct in

'Cuilidh mhic Ciaran,' the treasury of the son of Ciaran in 'Eileacha Naomh,' Holy Isles.
Cuitil, caitil, caitiol, a fort, a stronghold, a case, a bier, a coffin.
The bier on which the dead and dying were removed from the battlefield
was called 'caisil-chro,' 'cuisil-chra,' blood bier.
The want ofwood in the Isles necessitated the people burying their dead
eitherwithoutcoffinsorinstonecists. ItwasonlywhentheAmericantimber trade began and wood was cast on their wild shores, or could be got from the South, that the use of coffins became general. Before then there was a 'cro-leapa,' dead-bed, in every townland to convey the body to the grave. Oldmen inLewsspeakofthelast'cro-leapa'being buriedwith the lastbody carried in it.

The Barons Livingstone of Bachuill, Lismore, were almoners to the church of St. Moluag in Lismore, the cathedral church of the see of Argyll and the Isles,foundedin1200. Theywereknownas'deora,'almoners,whilethesite of the old residence of the family is still called 'Larach taigh nan deora,' the site of the house of the almoners, and the brae below the house as 'Bruthach taighnandeora,'thedeclivityofthehouseofthealmoners. Thesealmoners were also keepers of the staff of St. Moluag, and assessors and collectors of the tithesofthediocese. Wheneverthecustodianofthestaffappearedwiththe staff as the emblem of his office, due obedience was given to him within his own special jurisdiction. Some interesting traditions are still current concerning someofthebaronsandtheirtravelsandthestaffofthesaintwhichtheycarried about, and to which miraculous powers were attributed. The custodian of the staff of St. Moluag possessed a freehold estate for his varied services.

 260 NOTES
The estate was ofconsiderable extent, but is now reduced to a small piece of land through the fraud of 'Domhull Dubh nan Ard,' Black Donald of Airds. Sir Donald Campbell of Airds, Appin, was a natural son of Campbell of Calder. HewasanecclesiasticwhenecclesiasticalaffairsinScotlandchangedcomplexion with the facility of the kaleidoscope, and Donald Campbell changed with them. When Catholicism was in the ascendant he was a Catholic, when Episcopacy superseded he was an Episcopalian, and when Presbyterianism was promising he was all for Presbyterian parity. He was nominated, possibly appointed,butnotconsecrated,bishopofArgyll. DonaldCampbellofAirds was a man of great ability, but utterly unscrupulous as to the means whereby to
attain his ends. His conduct towards Baron Livingstone of Bachuill, Baron Carmichael of Sguran, and other small proprietors in his neighbourhood, shows him to have been a man of extraordinary stratagem, duplicity, and rapacity.
Dr. David Livingstone was descended from these Barons Livingstone of Lismore. ThegreattravellerresembledhiskinsmenandclansmeninLismore inaremarkablemanner,physically,mentally,andmorally. Thepresentvener
able Baron Alexander Livingstone of Bachuill has been taken for his famous namesake. TheBaronhoweveristaller,beingnearlysixfeetinheight.
The 'Clann an Leigh,' 'Clann an Leighean,' children of the physicians, Livingstones of Bachuill, are said to be descended, like the famous Beaton physicians of Mull, Islay, Skye, and Reay, from Beatan, the Columban medical missionaryofIona, (Vol.i.p.78Jf!) 'Sgoiltidhandualchasachreag'— Heredity will cleave the rock. David Livingstone cleaved his way through rocks harder than any that his kindred had ever faced.
The Campbells of Bail-an-deor, in Lorn, were almoners to the Priory of Airdchattan. They were big powerful men. One of them is still spoken of as 'An Deora mor,' the big almoner, and 'Deora mor Bhail-an-deor,' the big
almoner of the townland of the almoner.
Robert Burns was a Campbell descended from Walter Campbell, Bogjoram,
Kincardine. ItisalmostifnotwhollycertainthatthisWalterCampbellwas the son of the 'Deora Mor,' and had to flee from home on account of the storm he raised against himself, under extreme provocation, in his treatment of the 'cliar sheannachain,' strolling satirists.
Here again heredity asserts itself, several of these Campbells of Bail-an-deor having been poets in olden and in modern times.
Near Bail-an-deor is the home of the 'Rusgain,' Ruskins. The Ruskins were in Glenlonain from time immemorial. Many pieces of sculpture have been found lying scattered about in various places in this beautiful glen. Someofthesearestillseen. 'Rusgan'meanspeeler,bark-peeler,hewer. A tradition still exists among the old people of the place that the Ruskins were 'luchd ceaird,' artisans; 'draoinich,' sculptors. There were schools of sculp tureintheHighlands. Oneofthesewasin'Innis-draoinich,'Lochawc,afew miles from Glenlonain, the home of the Ruskins. 'Innis draoinich ' means

The tradition of the Clerks of Duntannachain, Glenlonain, was that John Ruskin was descended from the Ruskins of Glenlonain. The Clerks were descended from educated parents and were an educated and intellectual family, one of them being the late Rev. Archibald Clerk, LL.D., the accomplished Celticscholar. ThefatherwasthelearnedfarmerspokenofbyDr.Macleod in his Reminiscences of a Highland Parish, and the mother was Margaret Carmichael, Lismore, sister of Captain Dugald Carmichael, of the 72nd High landers,'thefatherofmarinebotany'andthefriendofSirWilliamHooker.
The members of this family were unanimous in saying that John Ruskin was descended from a Ruskin who went south in one of the expeditions from Argyll, and who remained south. They said that the last of the Ruskins of Glenlonain who lived near them strongly resembled the distinguished writer mentally and physically.

The people were averse to the counting of men, or of flocks, or of anything, on a Friday. Monday or Sunday, especially the first Monday or the first Sunday of the quarter, was the auspicious day for counting flocks.

Next to these, and sometimes preferred to them, was Thursday, the day of Columba. •

Probably the mention of Ireland is in reference to the story of 'The Children of Lir,' one of the three great 'Sorrows of Story-telling.'
Although the singing of the swan is not generally acknowledged by ornitho logists,itisawidespreadandanoldbelief. SeveraloftheLatinpoetsspeakof it, and mention of it is also to be found in German and Russian authors. Cf. Mullenhoffs AUertumskunde, where an interesting account is given of the
song of the swan.
There are many references in Gaelic poetry to the song of the swan :—
'Bithidhmituillidhgutursachdeurach, Ishallhenceforthbesorrowful,tearful, Marealabhanandeighareubadh, Liketothewhiteswanaftersheiswounded,

Vows' were made upon the swan. In Uist the vow took a negative form. Vows of constancy were made on 'righinn na h-ealt,' the queen of the bird- kingdom :—
'Feumaidhmimoghruagaghearradh, Imustneedstonsuremyhair, Usm'aithreachasadhubladh, Anddoublemyrepentance,
Mo bhoidgugramailthoirdh'aneala, My vowgivefirmlytotheswan, Feuchammairmochliumi.' Toseeifmyfamewillcleavetome.
Dunbar, court poet to James iv., speaks of vowing upon the swan :—
'IwadgifallthateverIhave,
To that condition, so God me save, That ye had vowit on the swan
Ane year to be Johan Tamson's man.'
The swan was vowed upon in England also :— 'Edward vowed on the swan.'— Green's History.

In Arran, 'iasg eigir ' is a small fish, a dwarf fish, and 'iasgach eigir ' is a poorfishing,whetherforthenightorfortheseason. InBarra,'ubheigir'is a small egg, a dwarf egg, while 'uibhean eigir,' dwarf eggs, is a term applied to the eggs of the smallest sea and land birds. ,
'Eigir,' wrongly 'seigir,' is applied to the little gull, an occasional visitor, and more commonly to the kittiwake, the smallest permanent British gull.
'Eigire giullain ' is a puny boy ; 'eigire bodaich,' a miserly carle ; 'eigire truagh duine,' a mean, miserable man.

'Leac Eigir' is mentioned in a secular poem taken down in 1870 from Fearachar Beaton, shepherd, Corradale, South Uist. The poem is old and of geological interest.

The writer saw and spoke with men and women whose fathers and mothers had seen and succoured the Prince. The whole of these faithful people of Corradale, and hundreds more, were evicted and driven to

Famh-bhual,famh-fhual,lamh-fhual,water-mole,from'famh,'mole,and'bual,'water. Several names are applied to the water-shrew, as 'famh-bhual,' water-mole ; 'lamh-fhual,''labh-alan,'water-vole,and'bad-alan,'water-vole. Probably'labh' and 'lamh,' arise from the influence of the a of the article on aspirated 'famh,' mole. Thenamesofthewater-molehavetheircounterpartsinthenamesofthe land-mole.

The giants who live in caves and underground structures go under the names of 'famh,' mole, 'famhair ' and 'fuamhaire,' giant. A man much addicted to burrowing underground is called 'famh,' mole ; 'famhair ' and 'fuamhaire,' giant. Perhaps the 'famhair,' 'fuamhaire,' was the Titan of the Celt, the Cyclop of his underground structures, and the Fomorian of his history.

Far, the preposition 'on ' used in compounds, e.g. 'farasg,' false fish, fish found dead on the sea or shore ; spent fish, as 'fara-bhreac,' spent trout ; 'fara- bhradan,' spent salmon ; *fara-laogh,' false calf, monstrosity ; *fara-ghaol,' false love ; 'far-thir,' an out-of-the-way place ; 'far-thagh,' 'foireagh,' a certain amount of farm produce allowed to farm servants in olden times.
Farch, farch-chiuil, fairchil, a musical instrument, possibly the lute, probably the lyre. The'farch'ismentionedinthe'LayofFraoch,'takendownin1861 from Kenneth Morrison, Trithion, Skye :—

Cha do shin a thaobh ri smth.' Never stretched his side to flood.
Probably 'farch,' the musical instrument, is from the same root as 'farchin,' 'farch-chrann,' 'fara-chrann,' bread-toaster. Both being sharply curved, the one may have borrowed the name from the other, or both may have borrowed from a common source.

One of the Lords of the Isles was going along Bac, in Barra— some say Greinetobht, North Uist,— when he saw a black-haired, unkempt boy sitting at the edge of a cornfield husking ears of corn while basking in the sun and tendingthecattle.

goingthroughsomeshuttle-cockmovementsthatpuzzledusmuch. Intervening hillocks, windings of the road, and rapid driving prevented us for a time from having a continuous view of what was going on ; but having come to a place where we had a near and full view of the birds, we stopped our little phaeton, and watched their singular proceedings in breathless silence.
*There were ten or twelve ravens in all, I forget which, on the smooth green grass adjoining the dry strand, and about a hundred yards below where we stood. On a small elevation hard by stood a large, noble-looking raven, probably the Maccrimmon of his race, and piped a " port-a-bial," mouth-tune, loud, fast, and furious. Tothisalltheotherravensrespondedbyrunning,andhopping,and

Immediately thereafter all the ravens flew away, not in a body, and in one direction, as their congeners the crows would have done, but like a gang of thieves taken by surprise, all in different directions, and in variousways,notwoofthemgoingtogether. Ihavebeenfamiliarwithravens all my life,and atvarious times and in various places have seen numbers of them together ; but I never before saw a ravens' quadrille, and probably shall never see the same thing again.'

Just then the reiver sprang from a cleft in the rock behind the woman, and, seizing the cow by the horn, hurried her off to his galley ere the astonished owner could recover herself or summon her friends. The people say that the luck of Mac Iain Ghiorr began to decline after he took the widow's only cow, till at last he met the fate he had long merited.

When the 'glaistic' stretched out her lovely little hand and placed it on the coulter to give the required assurance, her hand was burnt to the bone. With a shriek of agony she flew out at the window and through the mist of the morning to the hillside beyond, and there she put out three bursts of the blood of her heart, which are still visible in the discoloured russet vegetation of the spot, and with each burstofbloodthe'glaistig'uttered a curse on Big Kennedyand onhisseed forever:—

In the Outer Isles the walls of the houses are very thick, varying from four to eight feet. A facing of stone is to the inside and another to the outside, the space between being filled with stones, gravel, or earth. The corners of the building are rounded, and there are no gables, the low walls being level right round. The roof is raised from the inner facing of the wall, the rest being laid over with turf and green grass, where pet sheep or lambs often graze, and occasionally— when the building abuts on a bank, as is sometimes thecase—acourageouscowandcalforevenamareandfoal. Twoorthreestone steps project from the wall near the door, to enable the family to ascend and descend when occasion requires.

There is probably no district in the Highlands where the 'gruagach ' could not befullydescribed.

She placed her left foot on Benbuidhe in Arran and her right foot on 'Allasan,' Ailsa Craig, making this her stepping-stone to cross to the mainlandofScotlandortoIreland. Whilethe'gruagach'wasintheactof moving her left foot, a three-masted ship passed beneath, the mainmast of which struckherinthethighandoverturnedherintothesea. ThepeopleofBennan mourned the 'gruagach' long and loudly, and bewailed their own officiousness.
'Gruagach' is now applied to a maiden, and occasionally, in derision, to amanwithlonghair. Butthatitwasnotalwayssoisevidencedbytheselines from an old ballad :—

The name 'Tir-iodh,' land of com, is singularly applicable to this low-lying,

The bird frequents the islands of Tiree and Coll, but is rarely seen elsewhere in the seas or sounds oftheInnerHebrides. ItkeepstotheopensoundsoftheOuterHebrides, while its congener, the pin-tailed duck, keeps still further out and exclusively to the open Atlantic, being rarely seen within the Outer Sounds. The two places most familiar to me as the habitat of the long-tailed duck are the Sound of Barra and the Sound of Harris, forty-four miles apart. In crossing these stormy straits of the Atlantic, I often observed the evident enjoyment of these beautiful birds in the tumult of waters. The more the stately mountainous waves, snow-white, foaming, roaring, broke over them, the more evident their

W h e n the tide is in, the long-tailed ducks diveforfryandsand-eels,andarecaughtonthehooksanddrowned. During a visit to m y friend and fellow-collector of folk-lore, the late Rev. Mr. Campbell of Tiree, I saw at Hian.iish, on the 23rd September 1887, seven of these graceful birds which had been drowned on one set of lines in one day.
In the island of Bearnarey (Bernera), in the Sound of Harris, there is a sept ofpeoplecalledClann'IcAnndaidh—ClanMacandy. Theseptconsistsnowof only a few families— most of them having left, being dissatisfied with the hard rockyandsterilesandynatureoftheplace. Locallegendsaysthatonehalf of the Macandys were keen lovers of the land, with its plants and animals, and declared by the golden sun that rules the day ; while the other half were keen lovers of the sea, with its plants and living creatures, and declared by the silvery moonandtwinklingstarsthatrulethenight. Thesea-lovingsectionlaughedat the land-loving section, and in her resentment at their scoffing the witch of the land-lovers struck the sea-lovers with her 'slacan druidheachd,' druidic wand, and placed them 'fo gheasaibh,' under enchantment, and ever since then one
sept of the Macandys are swimming on the sea, diving in the deep, and flying in the air, like gleams of light, while their kinsmen and clansmen are grubbing in the ground like earth-worms, their fellow-mortals.
The people of Bearnarey allege that the long-tailed ducks are the enchanted section of the Macandy tribe, and that the birds hail their kinsmen in the loud long laughter of their hearts with greetings which have been converted into human language. The following is attributed by his people to Macleod of Bearnarey, knighted on the field of Worcester :—

The stories of 'The Children of Lir,' 'The Children of Uisne,' and 'The Children of Tuirinn ' are called 'Tri Broin nan Sgeulachd,' the three sorrows ofstory-telling. Ahighlydramaticandbeautifulversionof'TheChildrenof Lir' was told in October 1871 by Hector Macleod, shoemaker, Iochdar, South Uist, to Iain Campbell of Islay and the writer.
O n the west side of the island of Vallay, North Uist, there is a sunken rock called'BoghaLir,'reefofLear. ItissaidthattheshipofLear,sonoftheking of Lochlann, struck on this reef, when Lear himself and all on board were lost.

TherearemanymermaidstoriesthroughouttheIsles. Itookdownseveral of these, some of which may be mentioned. Colin Campbell, crofter, Ceanntangbhal, Barra, saw, as he thought, an otter on a reef in 'Caolas Cumhan,' Barra. Theotterwasholdingandeatingafish,withhiseyesclosed,afterhis manner. The man raised his gun to fire, when to his surprise the creature beforehimlookedlikeawomanholdingachild.

The man was greatly astonished, and concluded that this must be the mermaid of whom he had often heard.
Inwardly thanking the loving Virgin for having withheld his hand, Campbell putuphisglass. Theclickoftheglassstartledthemermaid,andinthe twinklingofaneyesheandherchildwentintotheseawithasplash. Colin Campbell, an honest, intelligent, middle-aged man, firmly believed that he had seen the mermaid.
Neill Maceachain, crofter, Hough-beag, South Uist, was returning from the Clyde, where he and others had been with farm produce, before the days of steamersintheWest. TheywerebecalmedemergingfromtheSoundofMull. The sun was scorching, the air was breathless, and the surface of the sea was smooth as polished glass, when all were astonished to see a creature about two yardsfromthesideofthemotionlessskiff. Itshead,neck,breast,andshoulders resembled those of a woman, though its hair was more coarse, and its eyes more

Thenarratorofferednoexplanationofthe strange phenomenon, never having seen anything like it before, though all his lifeaccustomedtothesea. Oneofhiscompanions,however,saidthatitwas the mermaid, and declared that he had seen a creature exactly like itsome years previously, while making kelp at Airdmaoilean, South Uist.
Neill Maceachain was an entirely truthful man and incapable of inventing. He was one of nature's nobles, being richly endowed mentally and physically, and with a phenomenal memory. He was a relation of Neill Maceachain,
or MacDonald, father of Marshal MacDonald, Duke of Tarentum, and was remarkably like the duke in form and features as well as in temperament. He had seen and conversed with the duke when he visited his relatives in South Uist.
Some seventy years ago, people were cutting seaweed at Sgeir na duchadh, Grimnis,Benbecula. Beforeputtingonherstockings,oneofthewomenwent to the lower end of the reef to wash her feet. While doing so she heard a splash in the calm sea, and looking up she saw a creature in the form of a womaninminiature,somefewfeetaway. Alarmed,thewomancalledtoher friends, and all the people present rushed to the place.
The creature made somersaults and turned about in various directions. Somemenwadedintothewatertoseizeher,butshemovedbeyondtheirreach. Some boys threw stones at her, one of which struck her in the back. A few days afterwards, this strange creature was found dead at Cuile, Nunton, nearly two miles away.
The upper portion of the creature was about the size of a well-fed child of threeorfouryearsofage,withanabnormallydevelopedbreast. Thehairwas long,dark,andglossy,whiletheskinwaswhite,soft,andtender. Thelowerpart ofthebodywaslikeasalmon,butwithoutscales. Crowdsofpeople,somefrom long distances, came to see this strange animal, and all were unanimous in the opinion that they had gazed on the mermaid at last.

Thiswas done, and the body was buried in the presence of many people, a short distance above the shore where it was found.

Meirbh, to disintegrate, to digest ; in root akin to 'marbh,' to kill ; a place-name in Benbecula, Barra, Iona, and elsewhere.
A small lake in Benbecula is called 'Loch nam meirbh.' There are two islets about fifty yards apart on the lake, called respectively 'A Mheirbh Bheag,'LittleMeirbh,and'AMheirbhMhor,'LargeMeirbh. Inthecentre of the Little Meirbh is a circular hole in the rock, partly natural and partly artificial, like an inverted cone. In this cavity criminals were tied and left to die, the water of the lake covering their lower limbs. From this the remains were removed and buried in the larger Meirbh. This small mossy isle, the surface of which is only a few feet above water, is covered with 'bogha- mucag,' 'butha-mucag,' blue hyacinth, of great luxuriance and richness of colouring.
There is a small lake in Barra called 'Loch Tangastal,' and in it a small square keep called 'Tur Leoid,' the tower of Leod, the scene of Miss Porter's novel, St. Clair of the Islet. Jutting into the lake in the direction of the old tower is a flat sandy peninsula called 'A Mheirbh.'

Their host was a big grizzly- bearded man, whose face, hands, and feet were full of scars and mended bones, asifhehadfoughthiswaythroughsomedesperatebattle. AccordingtoCeltic custom the names of the guests were neither given nor asked till they were leaving. Whenthehostheardthenameandresidenceofhisleadingguest,he pointed to his scars and mended bones and addressed the man :—

'Iogan'(probably a diminutive of 'Iain'— John, possibly an old native name), was struck with terror and remorse, for this was a big seal who, with his wife and children and many other metamorphosed seals, had been visiting the homes and graves of their submerged fatherland in the Atlantic, when they were attacked, and some of them slain, by the Uist men, among whom was Iogan.

Nathair, serpent, adder. Several terms are applied to the serpent, as 'nathair,' serpent; 'nimhir,' venom; 'beithir,' lightning; 'righinn,' queen; and 'nighean Imhir,' daughter of Ivor; 'dearrais,' perverse. Probably 'nighean Imhir,' daughter of Ivor, is a mistake for 'an nimhir,' the serpent, while 'nighean' may be a mistake for 'ruain,' hue, coloured spot.
The serpent is now small and rare, though once large and numerous, in the Highlands. OnewaskilledatBailemonaidh,inIslay,intheearlyyearsofthe century, measuring nine feet in length and eighteen inches in circumference.

When shot, its enormously distended stomach was found to contain several twites, buntings, pipits, larks, and thrushes, and an incredible quantity of milk.
Only a few years ago a larger serpent than this was killed in a turnip-field in EasterRoss. Thepresenceofthereptilewasindicatedbythefearandanxiety displayed by a pair of well-trained horses working in the neighbourhood. Nothing could be seen, but the horses trembled violently, and, with nostrils dis tended and eyes staring, showed symptoms of great fear and could hardly be kept from running away from the men about them. When after some delay and difficulty the serpent was found and killed the horses quieted down, but for some days showed the effects of their fear.

The lastname isinreferencetothebeliefthat certainpeculiaritiesinthecryandflightofthebirdindicaterain. Thebird

During development the black-throated diver and the great northern diver are similar,althoughinmaturitydissimilar. Incourseofincubationnatureprovides birds with great heat, rendering them liable to great thirst. To obviate absence from the eggs and retardation of hatching, the black-throated diver makes her nest near water, generally on the bank of a lake, occasionally on the edge of a stream. Thenestissimplyadepressioninthemosswithinreachofthewater. Should drought occur, and the water subside below her reach, the bird flies abouthitherandthitherutteringcriesofconcern.

In Norway the -horse-fight took place in August, on Lovisae Dag, the horse- combat finishing up the sports of the festival. By a curious coincidence, the horse-races of Norway and the principal horse-race of the Western Isles, that of South Uist, ceased in the same year, 1820, and in two succeeding months.

 NOTES 315
A plain near Loch Snizort, a plain near Glendale, and a plain in Minginis, Skye, are called 'odaig,' racecourse, horse racecourse.
The last great 'oda' occurred in Barra in 1828, in South Uist in 1820, in Benbeculain1830,inNorthUistin1866,andinHarrisin1818. Inthe Small Isles the 'oda ' continued later, while occasional 'oda ' have been held in all these places since the years mentioned.
In Barra the 'oda' was held on the 25th September, being the Day of St. Barr, the patron saint of the island ; in all the other places on 29th September, being the Day of St. Michael, the patron saint of horses and of the Isles.
In Barra the sports were held on 'Traigh Bharra,' Strand of St. Barr ; in South Uist, on 'Traigh Mhicheil,' Strand of St. Michael ; in Benbecula, on 'Machair Bhaile-mhanaich,' plain of the townland of the monks ; in North Uist, on 'Traigh Mhoire,' Strand of St. Mary ; and in Harris, on 'Traigh Chliamain,' Strand of St. Clement.
All these places are singularly adapted for man-racing, horse-racing, and other sports.
'Oda nan gillean,' race of the youths ; 'oda nan each,' race of the horses ; 'eachoda,'racehorse;'ramhoda,''odaramh,'oar-race. IntheAncientIrish Annals Ennis is called 'Inis Cluan ramh fhoda,' pasture-meadow of the long rowing. ProbablytheIrish'fhoda,'long,istheAlban'oda,'race. Thefhin 'fhoda ' is silent. If this suggestion be correct, the rendering should be : pasture-meadow of the oar-racing— boat-racing.

The earth was again placed upon Oran, and he was buried permanently. 'Columba wept sorrowfully, heavily, and shed the tears showeringly, gener
ously, because Oran tender, lovable, faithful, and earnest, went to death.
'That was the first person who was buried in that place, and the name " Burial-place of Oran " was given to it. A chapel was placed on Oran, and
" Temple of Oran " was given as a name to the chapel.'
There may be some truth in this tradition, although probably much altered.
The period of three days and three nights in the grave is symbolic of Christ. Probably human sacrifices were placed under the foundation-wall of St. Oran's Temple, whether or not Oran was the name of the man sacrificed. Human sacrifices were placed under buildings in ancient Greece and Rome, and under buildings in modern England, Ireland, and Scotland. A well-known Greek case was that of the Bridge of Arta, which only stood secure after the master

'Seachd/ seven, expresses perfection, completeness, as 'seachd sgith,' utterly tired, 'seachd searbh,' the height of bitterness, 'seachd sath,' perfect satiation. Hence its use in the following phrases :— 'seachd beannachd ort,' seven blessings on you ; 'seachd mallachd ort,' seven cursings on you ; 'seachd seacharain seilg ort,' seven hunt wanderings on you, 'seachd gloir," seven glories, 'seachd deamhain,' seven devils, 'seachd sagart,' seven priests, 'seachd sitheach,' seven fairies.
Many more examples of the number seven could be given, but the following will suffice. It was taken down in I860, with much more old lore, from Kenneth Morrison, cottar, Trithion, Skye.

In October 1871, the late J. F. Campbell of Islay and the writer were storm- stayedintheprecipitousislandofMiunghlaidh,Barra. Weoccupiedourtime in listening to the folklore of the people by whom we were so kindly treated. One of these was Roderick Macneill, known as 'Ruaraidh mac Dhomhuil,' Roderick the son of Donald, a famous storyteller and a man wondrously endowed mentallyandphysically. Macneillwasthenninety-twoyearsofage. Hehad neverbeenill,andneverhadshoeson,andneverhadtastedtea. Hischestwas asroundasabarrel,andmeasuredforty-eightinchesincircumference. Hehad been an extraordinary 'rocker'after birds, moving about on precipices of eight hundred feet sheer down to the sea, where a goat or even a cat might hesitate togo. Sopowerfulwasthemanthatwhereverhisfingerscouldgetinsertionin the crevices of the rock he could move his body along the face of the precipice
without any other support.
One of the many tales he told us was that of the origin of the fairies, which

These are the fairy folks— ever since doomed to live under the ground, and onlypermittedtoemergewhenandwheretheKingpermits. Theyarenever allowed abroad on Thursday, that being Columba's Day, nor on Friday, that being the Son's Day, nor on Saturday, that being Mary's Day, nor on Sunday, that being the Lord's Day.

I took down several stories of persons who went with the 'hosts.' Here is one of the stories of the 'hosts ' summarised :— The beautiful daughter of a king of France was taken up by the 'hosts,' and carried about in the air, over lands and seas, continents and islands, till they came to the little island of Heistamal, behind Creagorry, in Benbecula, where they laid her down in such an injured state that she died from the hard treatment; not, however, till she had told about the lands to which she had been carried, and of the greathardshipsshehadenduredwhiletravellingthroughspace. Thepeopleof the island buried the princess where she was found.
The 'sluagh 'are supposed to come from the west ; and therefore, when a person is dying, the door and the windows on the west side of the house are secured to keep out the malicious spirits. In Ross-shire, the door and windows of a house in which a person is dying are opened, in order that the liberated soul mayescapetoheaven.

The neid-fire was resorted to in imminent or actual calamity upon the first day of the quarter, and to ensure success in great or important events.
The writer conversed with several persons who saw the neid-fire made, and whojoinedintheceremony.
