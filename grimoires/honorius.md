# The Grimoire Of Honorius

The person who desires to invoke the perverse "Spirits of Darkness" must observe a
three days' fast; he must also confess and approach the Holy Altar. After these three
days, upon the morrow, and at the hour of sunrise, he shall recite the Seven Gradual
Psalms, with the accompanying Litanies and Prayers, the whole on his knees; further,
he must drink no wine and eat no meat on that day. Next, he shall rise at midnight on
the first Monday of the month, and a priest shall say a Mass of the Holy
Ghost. After the consecration, taking the Host in his left hand, he shall
recite the following prayer on his knees:

## PRAYER

My Sovereign Saviour Jesus Christ, Son of the living God! Thou who
for the salvation of all mankind didst suffer the death of the Cross; Thou
who, before being abandoned to Thine enemies, by an impulse of
ineffable love didst institute the Sacrament of thy Body; Thou who hast
vouchsafed to us miserable creatures the privilege of making daily
commemoration thereof; do Thou deign unto thine unworthy servant, thus
holding thy Living Body in his hands, all strength and ability for the
profitable application of that power with which he has been entrusted
against the horde of rebellious spirits. Thou art their true God, and if they
tremble at the utterance of Thy Name, upon that Holy Name will I call,
crying Jesus Christ! Jesus, be Thou my help, now and for ever! Amen.

After sunrise a black cock must be killed, the first feather of its left wing
being plucked and preserved for use at the required time. The eyes must
be torn out, and so also the tongue and heart; these must be dried in the
sun and afterwards reduced to powder. The remains must be interred at
sunset in a secret place, a cross of a palm in height being set upon the
mound, while at each of the four corners the signs which here follow
must be drawn with the thumb:

<img src="/static/images/content/honorius-figure-1.png" alt="Drawn symbols">

On this day also the operator should drink no wine and abstain from
eating meat.

On Tuesday, at break of day, let him say a Mass of the Angels, placing
the feather taken from the bird upon the altar, together with a new
penknife. The signs hereinafter represented must be inscribed on a sheet
of clean paper with the consecrated wine which is the Blood of Jesus
Christ:

<img src="/static/images/content/honorius-figure-2.png" alt="Drawn symbols">

They should be written upon the altar, and at the end of the Mass the
paper should be folded in a new veil of violet silk, to be concealed on the
morrow, together with the oblation of the Mass and a part of the
consecrated Host.

On the evening of Thursday the operator must rise at midnight, and, having sprinkled
holy water about the chamber, he must light a taper of yellow wax, which shall have been
prepared on the Wednesday and pierced in the form of a cross. When it is
lighted he shall recite Psalm _lxxvii. &mdash; Attendite, popule meus, legem meam,_
&c. &mdash; without the _Gloria Patri_. He shall then begin the "Office of the
Dead" with _Venite exultemus Domino,_ &c. He shall recite Matins and
Lauds, but in place of the versicle of the ninth Lesson 1 he shall say:

Deliver us, O Lord, from the fear of hell. Let not the demons destroy my soul when I
shall raise them from the deep pit, when I shall command them to do my
will. May the day be bright, may the sun and moon shine forth, when I shall
call upon them. Terrible of aspect are they, deformed and horrible to sight;
but do Thou restore unto them their angelic shapes when I shall impose my
will upon them. O Lord deliver me from those of the dread visage, and grant
that they shall be obedient when I shall raise them up from hell, when I
shall impose my will upon them.

After the "Office of the Dead" the operator shall extinguish the taper, and
at sunrise shall cut the throat of a male lamb of nine days, taking care that
the blood does not gush forth upon the earth. He shall skin the lamb, and
shall cast its tongue and heart into the fire. The fire must be freshly kindled,
and the ashes shall be preserved for use at the proper time. The skin of the
lamb shall be spread in the middle of a field, and for the space of nine days
shall be sprinkled four times every day with holy water. On the tenth day,
before the rising of the sun, the lambskin shall be covered with the ashes of
the heart and tongue, and with the ashes also of the
cock. On Thursday, after sunset, the flesh of the lamb shall be interred in a
secret place where no bird can come, and the priest with his right thumb
shall inscribe on the grave the characters here indicated:

<img src="/static/images/content/honorius-figure-3.png" alt="Drawn symbols">

Moreover, for the space of three days he shall sprinkle the four corners with
holy water, saying: Sprinkle me, O Lord, with hyssop, and I shall be
cleansed! Wash me, and I shall be made whiter than snow!

After the aspersion let him recite the following prayer, kneeling with his
face towards the east

## PRAYER.

Christ Jesus, Redeemer of men, who, being the Lamb without spot, wast
immolated for the salvation of the human race, who alone wast found
worthy to open the Book of Life, impart such virtue to this lambskin that it
may receive the signs which we shall trace thereon, written with Thy blood,
so that the figures, signs, and words may become efficacious; and grant that
this skin may preserve us against the wiles of the demons; that they may be
terrified at the sight of these figures, and may only approach them
trembling. Through Thee, Jesus Christ, who livest and reignest through all
ages. So be it.

The Litanies of the Holy Name of Jesus must then be repeated, but
instead of the _Agnus Dei_, substitute:

Immolated Lamb, be Thou a pillar of strength against the demons Slain
Lamb, give power over the Powers of Darkness! Immolated Lamb, grant
favour and strength unto the binding of the Rebellious Spirits. So be it.

The lambskin shall be stretched for eighteen days, and on the nineteenth
day the fleece shall be removed, reduced into powder, and interred in the
same place. The word vellus shall be written above it with the finger,
together with the following character and the words: May this which hath
been reduced into ashes preserve against the demons through the name of
Jesus.

<img src="/static/images/content/honorius-figure-4.png" alt="Drawn symbols">

Add also these signs

<img src="/static/images/content/honorius-figure-5.png" alt="Drawn symbols">

Lastly, on the eastern side, the said skin must be
set to dry in the sun for three days, the ensuing characters being cut with a
new knife:

<img src="/static/images/content/honorius-figure-6.png" alt="Drawn symbols">

&mdash; This being accomplished, recite Psalm lxxi., _Deus,
iudicium tuum regi da_, &c., and cut the following characters

<img src="/static/images/content/honorius-figure-7.png" alt="Drawn symbols">

The figure being thus far completed, recite the verses _Afferte Domino,
patriæ gentium_, occurring in Psalm xcv.:

_Cantate Domino Canticum novum_, of which the seventh versicle is:
_Afferte Domino, Filii Dei_, &c., and cut subsequently these characters:

<img src="/static/images/content/honorius-figure-8.png" alt="Drawn symbols">

&mdash; Next recite Psalm lxxvii.: _Attendite, popule meus,
legem meam_, and compose the following figure:

<img src="/static/images/content/honorius-figure-9.png" alt="Drawn symbols">

&mdash;  Which being accomplished, recite Psalm ii.: _Quare
fremuerunt Gentes, et populi meditati sunt inania?_ Then make another
figure as follows

<img src="/static/images/content/honorius-figure-10.png" alt="Drawn symbols">

And recite Psalm cxv.: _Credidi propter quod locutus sum_. Finally, on
the last day of the month a Mass for the Dead shall be offered; the prose
shall be omitted, and also the Gospel of St. John, but at the end of the Mass
the priest shall recite the Psalm _Confitemini Domino quoniam bonus_, &c.

In Honour of the Most Holy and August Trinity, the
Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghost. Amen.

_The Seventy-two Sacred Names of God._ &mdash; TRINITAS, SOTHER, MESSIAS, EMMANUEL, SABAHOT, ADONAY, ATHANATOS, JESU, PENTAGNA, AGRAGON, ISCHIROS, ELEYSON, OTHEOS, TETRAGRAMMATON, ELY, SADAY, AQUILA, MAGNUS HOMO, VISIO, FLOS, ORIGO, SALVATOR, ALPHA AND OMEGA, PRIMUS, NOVISSIMUS, PRINCIPIUM ET FINIS, PRIMOGENITUS, SAPIENTIA, VIRTUS, PARACLITUS, VERITAS, VIA, MEDIATOR, MEDICUS, SALUS, AGNUS, OVIS, VITULUS, SPES, ARIES, LEO, LUX, IMAGO, PANIS, JANUA, PETRA, SPONSA, PASTOR, PROPHETA, SACERDOS, SANCTUS, IMMORTALITAS, JESUS, CHRISTUS, PATER, FILIUS HOMINIS, SANCTUS, PATER OMNIPOTENS, DEUS, AGIOS, RESURRECTIO, MISCHIROS, CHARITAS, ÆTERNAS, CREATOR, REDEMPTOR, UNITAS, SUMMUM BONUM, INFINITAS.

Hereinafter follow the three small pentacles of Solomon, and that of
the Gospel of St. John.

<img src="/static/images/content/honorius-pentacles.png" alt="Three small pentacles of Solomon, and a pentacle of St. John">

_The Beginning of the Holy Gospel according to John. Glory be to Thee, O Lord._

In the beginning was the Word, &c., _in extenso, so far as the end of
the fourteenth versicle._

Thanks be to God. Hosanna to the Son of David!
Blessed is He who cometh in the Name of the Lord.
Hosanna in the Highest. We invoke Thee. We adore Thee. We praise
Thee. We glorify Thee, O blessed and glorious Trinity! May the
Name of the Lord be blessed, now and henceforth for ever! Amen. In
the Name of the Father, of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost, Jesus of
Nazareth, King of the Jews. May Christ conquer, reign, command,
and defend me from all evil. Amen.

## UNIVERSAL CONJURATION.

I, N., do conjure thee, O Spirit N., by the living God, by the true God, by
the holy and all-ruling God, who created from nothingness the heaven, the
earth, the sea, and all things that are therein, in virtue of the Most Holy
Sacrament of the Eucharist, in the name of Jesus Christ, and by the power
of this same Almighty Son of God, who for us and for our redemption was
crucified, suffered death, and was buried; who rose again on the third day,
and is now seated on the right hand of the Creator of the whole world, from
whence he will come to judge the living and the dead; as also by the
precious love of the Holy Spirit, perfect Trinity. I conjure thee within the
circle, accursed one, by thy judgment, who didst dare to tempt God: I
exorcise thee, Serpent, and I command thee to appear forthwith under a
beautiful and well-favoured human form of soul and body, and to fulfil my
behests without any deceit whatsoever, as also without mental reservation
of any kind, by the great times of the God of gods and Lord of lords,
ADONAY, TETRAGRAMMATON, JEHOVA, TETRAGRAMMATON,
ADONAY, JEHOVA, OTHEOS, ATHANATOS, ISCHYROS, AGLA,
PENTACRAMMATON, SADAY, SADAY, SADAY, JEHOVA,
OTHEOS, ATHANATOS à _Liciat_ TETRAGRAMMATON, ADONAY,
ISCHYROS, ATHANATOS, SADY, SADY, SADY, CADOS, CADOS,
CADOS, ELOY. AGLA, AGLA, AGLA, ADONAY, ADONAY.

I conjure thee, Evil and Accursed Serpent, N.. to appear at my will and
pleasure, in this place, before this circle, without tarrying, without
companions, without grievance, without noise, deformity, or murmuring. I
exorcise thee by the ineffable names of God, to wit, Gog and Magog, which
I am unworthy to pronounce; Come hither, Conic hither, Come hither.
Accomplish my will and desire, without wile or falsehood. Otherwise St.
Michael, the invisible Archangel, shall presently blast thee in the utmost
depths of hell. Come, then, N., to do my will.

The Grand Pentacle of Salomon
<img src="/static/images/content/honorius-grand-pentacle.png" alt="The Grand Pentacle of Salomon">
A.P.

Why tarriest thou, and why delayest? What doest thou? Make ready, obey
your master, in the name of the Lord, BATHAT or RACHAT flowing over
ABRACM ENS, ALCHOR or ABERER.

L. Q. L. F. A. P.

Behold the Pentacle of Solomon which I have brought into thy presence! I
command thee, by order of the great God, ADONAY,
TETRAGRAMMATON, and JESUS!

Hasten, fulfil my behests, without wile or falsehood, but in all truth, in the
name of the Saviour and Redeemer, Jesus Christ.

### _DISCHARGE._

Go in peace unto your places. May there be peace between us and you, and be ye ready
to come when ye are called. In the Name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy
Ghost. Amen.

### _ACT OF THANKSGIVING._

Praise, honour, glory, and blessing be unto Him who sitteth upon the throne, who liveth
for ever and ever. Amen.

### _CONJURATION OF THE BOOK._

I conjure thee, O Book, to be useful and profitable unto all who shall have
recourse to thee for the success of their affairs. I conjure thee anew, by the
virtue of the Blood of Jesus Christ, contained daily in the chalice, to be
serviceable unto all those who shall read thee. I exorcise thee, in the name
of the Most Holy Trinity, in the name of the Most Holy Trinity, in the
name of the Most Holy Trinity!

_What follows must be said before the sealing of the Book._

I conjure and command you, O Spirits, all and so many as ye are, to accept
this Book with good grace, so that whensoever we may read it, the same
being approved and recognised as in proper form and valid, you shall be
constrained to appear in comely human form when you are called,
accordingly as the reader shall judge. In no circumstances shall you make
any attempt upon the body, soul, or spirit of the reader, nor inflict any harm
on those who may accompany him, either by mutterings, tempests, noise,
scandals, nor yet by lesion or by hindrance in the execution of the
commands of this Book. I conjure you to appear immediately when the
conjuration is made, to execute without dallying all that is written and
enumerated in its proper place in the said book. You shall obey, serve,
instruct, impart, and perform all in your power for the benefit of those who
command you, and the whole without illusion. If perchance some of the
invoked spirits be unable to come or appear when required, they shall be
bound over to send others vested with their power, who also shall swear
solemnly to execute all that the reader may demand, and ye are all hereby
enjoined by the Most Holy Names of the Omnipotent Living God,
ELOYM, JAH, EL, ELOY, TETRAGRAMMATON, to fulfil everything as
it is set forth above. If ye obey me not, I will force you to abide in torments
for a thousand years, as also if any one of you receive not this Book with
entire resignation to the will of the reader.

## CONJURATION OF THE DEMONS.

In the Name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost. Take
heed! Come, all Spirits! By the virtue and power of your King, and by the
seven crowns and chains of your Kings, all Spirits of the Hells are forced to
appear in my presence before this pentacle or circle of Solomon,
whensoever I shall call them. Come, then, all at my orders, to fulfil that
which is in your power, as commanded. Come, therefore, from the East,
South, West, and North! I conjure and command you, by the virtue and
power of Him who is three, eternal, equal, who is God invisible,
consubstantial, in a word, who has created the heavens, the sea, and all
which is under heaven.

_After these Conjurations you shall command them to
affix the Seal._

## CONCERNING THE FIGURE OF THE CIRCLE.

Circles should be described with charcoal or holy water, sprinkled with
the wood of the blessed Cross.

<img src="/static/images/content/honorius-magic-circle.png" alt="The magic circle of Honorius">

The Magic Circle of Honorius

When they have been duly made, and the words have been written about
the circle, the holy water which has served to bless the same may also be
used to prevent the spirits from inflicting any hurt. Standing in the middle
of the circle, you shall command them in a lively manner, as one who is
their master.

### _What must be said in Composing the Circle._

O Lord, we fly to Thy virtue! O Lord, confirm this work! What is operated
in us becomes like dust driven before the wind, and the Angel of the Lord
pausing (sic), let the darkness disappear, and the Angel of the Lord ever
pursuing, ALPHA, OMEGA, ELY, ELOTHE, FLOHIM, ZABAHOT,
FLION, SADY. Behold the Lion who is the conqueror of the Tribe of
Judah, the Root of David! I will open the Book, and the seven seals thereof.
I have beheld Satan as a bolt falling from heaven. It is Thou who hast given
us power to crush dragons, scorpions, and all Thine enemies beneath Thy
feet. Nothing shall harm us, not even ELOY, ELOHIM, ELOHE,
ZABAHOT, ELION, ESARCHIE, ADONAY, JAH,
TETRAGRAMMATON, SADY. The earth is the Lord's and all those who
dwell therein, because He established it upon the seas and prepared it in the
midst of the waves. Who shall ascend unto the mountain of the Lord? Who
shall be received in his Holy Place? The innocent of hands and clean of
heart. Who bath not received his soul in vain, and hath not sworn false
witness against his neighbour. The same shall be blessed of God, and shall
obtain mercy of God to his salvation. He is of the generation of those who 
seek Him. Open your gates, ye princes, open the eternal gates, and the
King of Glory shall enter! Who is this King of Glory? The Lord Almighty,
the Lord, mighty in battle. Open your gates, ye princes! Lift up the eternal
gates. Who is this King of Glory? The Lord Almighty. This Lord is the
King of Glory. Glory be to the Father, &c.

_To dismiss them, the Pentacle of Solomon must be exhibited, at the same
time saying as follows_: &mdash; Behold your sentence! Behold that which
forbids
rebellion to our wills, and doth ordain you to return unto your abodes. May
peace be between us and you, and be my will.

<img src="/static/images/content/honorius-king-east.png" alt="Star of the King of the East">

## CONJURATION OF THE KING OF THE EAST.

I conjure and invoke thee, O powerful King of the East Magoa, by my holy
labour, by all the names of Divinity, by the name of the All-Powerful: I
command thee to obey, and to come to me, or that failing, forthwith and
immediately to send unto me Massayel, Ariel, Satiel, Arduel, Acorib, to
respond concerning all that I would know and to fulfil all that I shall
command. Else thou shalt come verily in thine own person to satisfy my
will; which refusing, I shall compel thee by all the virtue and power of
God.

The Grand Pentacle or Circle of Solomon will answer for the above and
following Conjurations, which can be said on all days and at all hours. If it
be desired to speak only with one spirit, one only need be named, at the
choice of the reader.

## CONJURATION OF THE KING OF THE SOUTH.

O Egym, great King of the South, I conjure and invoke thee by the most
high and holy Names of God, do thou here manifest, clothed with all thy
power; come before this circle, or at least send me forthwith Fadal,
Nastrache, to make answer unto me, and to execute all my wishes. If thou
failest, I shall force thee by God Himself.

## CONJURATION OF THE KING OF THE WEST.

O Baymon, most potent King, who reignest in the Western quarter, I call
and I invoke thee in the name of the Deity! I command thee by virtue of the
Most High, to send me immediately before this circle the Spirit Passiel
Rosus, with all other Spirits who are subject unto thee, that the same may
answer in everything, even as I shall require them. If thou failest, I will
torment thee with the sword of fire divine; I will multiply thy sufferings,
and will burn thee.

## CONJURATION OF THE KING OF THE NORTH.

O thou, Amaymon, King and Emperor of the Northern parts, I call, invoke,
exorcise, and conjure thee, by the virtue and power of the Creator, and by
the virtue of virtues, to send me presently, and without delay, Madael,
Laaval, Bamlahe, Belem, and Ramath, with all other Spirits of thine
obedience, in comely and human form! In whatsoever place thou now art,
come hither and render that honour which thou owest to the true living
God, who is thy Creator. In the name of the Father, of the Son, and of the
Holy Ghost, come therefore, and be obedient, in front of this circle, without
peril to my body or soul. Appear in comely human form, with no terror
encompassing thee. I conjure thee, make haste, come straightway, and at
once. By all the Divine names— SECHIEL, BARACHIEL—if thou dost
not obey promptly, BALANDIER, _suspensus, iracundus, Origratiumgu,
Partus, Olemdemis, and Bautratis,_ N. I exorcise thee, do invoke, and do
impose most high commandment upon thee, by the omnipotence of the
living God, and of the true God; by the virtue of the holy God, and by the
power of Him who spake and all things were made, even by His holy
commandment the heaven and earth were made, with all that is in them! I
adjure thee by the Father, by the Son, and by the Holy Ghost, even by the
Holy Trinity, by that God whom thou canst not resist, under whose empire I
will compel thee; I conjure thee by God the Father, by God the Son, by God
the Holy Ghost, by the Mother of Jesus Christ, Holy Mother and perpetual
Virgin, by her sacred heart, by her blessed milk, which the Son of the
Father sucked, by her most holy body and soul, by all the parts and
members of this Virgin, by all the sufferings, afflictions, labours, agonies
which she endured during the whole course of her life, by all the sighs she
uttered, by the holy tears which she shed whilst her dear Son wept before
the time of His dolorous passion and on the tree of the Cross, by all the
sacred holy things which are offered and done, and also by all others, as in
heaven so on earth, in honour of our Saviour Jesus Christ, and of the
Blessed Mary, His Mother, by whatsoever is celestial, by the Church
Militant, in honour of the Virgin and of all the Saints. In like manner, I
conjure thee by the Holy Trinity, by all other mysteries, by the sign of the
Cross, by the most precious blood and water which flowed from the side of
Jesus Christ, by the sweat which issued from His whole body, when He
said in the Garden of Olives: My Father, if it be possible, let this chalice
pass from me—I conjure thee by His death and passion, by His burial and
glorious resurrection, by His ascension, by the coming of the Holy Ghost. I
adjure thee, furthermore, by the crown of thorns which was set upon His
head, by the blood which flowed from His feet and hands, by the nails with
which He was nailed to the tree of the Cross, by the holy tears which He
shed, by all which He suffered willingly through great love of us: by the
lungs, the heart, the hair, the inward parts, and by all the members, of our
Saviour Jesus Christ. I conjure thee by the judgment of the living and the
dead, by the Gospel words of our Saviour Jesus Christ, by His preachings,
by His sayings, by all His miracles, by the child in swaddling-clothes, by
the crying child, borne by the mother in her most pure and virginal womb;
by the glorious intercession of the Virgin Mother of our Saviour Jesus
Christ; by all which is of God and of His Most Holy Mother, as in heaven
so on earth. I conjure thee by the holy Angels and Archangels, and by all
the blessed orders of Spirits, by the holy patriarchs and prophets, by all the
holy martyrs and confessors, by all the holy virgins and innocent widows,
and by all the saints of God, both men and women. I conjure thee by the
head of St. John the Baptist, by the milk of St. Catherine, and by all the
Saints.

the glorious Virgin Mary, and of the Most Holy Trinity, in whose honour

Apostles, and Evangelists sing without end; Hosannah, Hosannah,
Hosannah, Lord God of Hosts, who art, who wast, who art to come, as a
river of burning fire! Neglect not my commands, refuse not to come. I
command thee by Him who shall appear with flames to judge the living and
the dead, unto whom is all honour, praise, and glory. Come, therefore,

soon as he appears burnt bread must be given him. Ask him anything you
will, and he will obey you on the spot. Write in his circle: Enter not,
Guland! Enter not, Guland! Enter not, Guland!

#### CONJURATION.

I conjure thee, O Guland, in the name of Satan, in the name of Beelzebuth,
in the name of Astaroth, and in the name of all other Spirits, to make haste
and appear before me. Come, then in the name of Satan and in the names of
all other demons. Come to me, I command thee, in the name of the Most
Holy Trinity. Come without inflicting any harm upon me, without injury to
my body or soul, without maltreating my books, or anything which I use. I
command thee to appear without delay, or, that failing, to send me
forthwith another Spirit having the same power as thou hast, who shall
accomplish my commands and be submitted to my will, wanting which, he
whom thou shalt send me, if indeed thou comest not thyself, shall in no
wise depart, nor until he bath in all things fulfilled my desire.

### _For Sunday, to Surgat._
This experience is performed at night from eleven to one o'clock. He will
demand a hair of your head, but give him one of a fox, and see that he takes
it. His office is to discover and transport all treasures, and perform anything
that you may will. Write in his circle:
TETRAGRAMMATON, TETRAGRAMMATON, TETRAGRAMMATON.
ISMAEL, ADONAY, IHUA. And in a second circle:

Come, Surgat! Come, Surgat! Come, Surgat!

#### CONJURATION.

I conjure thee, O Surgat, by all the names which are written in this book, to present
thyself here before me, promptly and without delay, being ready to obey me in all things,
or, failing this, to despatch me a Spirit with a stone which shall make me invisible to
every one whensoever I carry it! And I conjure thee to be submitted in thine own person,
or in the person of him or of those whom thou shalt send me, to do and accomplish my
will, and all that I shall command, without harm to me or to any one, so soon as I make
known my intent.

### _Very Powerful Conjuration for all days and hours of the Day or Night, being for Treasures hidden by men or Spirits, that the same may be possessed and transported._

I command you, O all ye demons dwelling in these parts, or in what part of
the world soever ye may be, by whatsoever power may have been given
you by God and our holy Angels over this place, and by the powerful
Principality of the infernal abysses, as also by all your brethren, both
general and special demons, whether dwelling in the East, West, South, or
North, or in any side of the earth, and, in like manner, by the power ofGod
the Father, by the wisdom of God the Son, by the virtue of the Holy Ghost,
and by the authority I derive from our Saviour Jesus Christ, the only Son of
the Almighty and the Creator, who made us and all creatures from nothing,
who also ordains that you do hereby abdicate all power to guard, habit, and
abide in this place; by whom further I constrain and command you, nolens
volens, without guile or deception, to declare me your names, and to leave
me in peaceable possession and rule over this place, of whatsoever legion
you be and of whatsoever part of the world; by order of the Most Holy
Trinity, and by the merits of the Most Holy and Blessed Virgin, as also of
all the saints, I unbind you all, spirits who abide in this place, and I drive
you to the deepest infernal abysses. Thus: Go, all Spirits accursed, who are
condemned to the flame eternal which is prepared for you and your
companions, if ye be rebellious and disobedient. I conjure you by the same
authority, I exhort and call you, I constrain and command you, by all the
powers of your superior demons, to come, obey, and reply positively to
what I direct you in the name of Jesus Christ. Whence, if you or they do not
obey promptly and without tarrying, I will shortly increase your torments
for a thousand years in hell. I constrain you therefore to appear here in
comely human shape, by the Most High Names of God, HAIN, LON,
HILAY, SABAOTH, HELIM, RADISH~~, LEDIEHA, ADONAY,
JEHOVA, YAH, TETRAGRAMMATON, SADA!, MESSIAS, AGIOS,
ISCHYROS, EMMANUEL, AGLA, Jesus who is ALPHA and OMEGA,
the beginning and the end, that you be justly established in the fire, having
no power to reside, habit, or abide in this place henceforth; and I require
your doom by the virtue of the said names, to wit, that St. Michael drive
you to the uttermost of the infernal abyss, in the name of the Father, and of
the Son, and of the Holy Ghost. So I conjure thee, Acham, or whomsoever
thou mayst be,
by the Most Holy Names of God, by MALHAME, JAE,
MAY, MABRON, JACOB, DASMEDIAS, ELOY, ATERESTIN,
JANASTARDY, FINI5, AGIos, JSCHYROS, OTHEOS, ATHANATOS,
AGLA, JEHOVA, HOMOSION, AGA, MESSIAS, SOTHER,
CHRISTUS VINCIT, CHRISTUS IMPERAT, INCREATUS SPIRITUS
SANCTUS.

I conjure thee, Cassiel, or whomsoever thou mayest be, by all the said
names, with power and with exorcism! I warn thee by the other sacred
names of the most great Creator, which are or shall hereafter be
communicated to thee; hearken forthwith and immediately to my words,
and observe them inviolably, as sentences of the last dreadful day of
judgment, which thou must obey inviolately, nor think to repulse me
because I am a sinner, for therein shalt thou repulse the commands of the
Most High God. Knowest thou not that thou art bereft of thy powers before
thy Creator and ours? Think therefore what thou refusest, and pledge
therefore thine obedience, swearing by the said last dreadful day of
judgment, and by Him who bath created all things by His word, whom all
creatures obey. P. _per sedem Baldarey et per gratiam et diligentiam tuam
habuisti ab eo hanc nalatimanamilam_, as I command thee.
