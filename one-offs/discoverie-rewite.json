        "original_title": "How men have beene bewitched, cousened or abused by dreames to dig and search for monie",
        "content": "How many have been bewitched with dreams, and thereby made to consume themselves with digging and searching for money, et cetera: whereof they, or some others dreamt? I myself could manifest as having known how wise men have been that way absed by very simple persons, even where no dream has been met, but waking dreams. And this has been used heretofor, as one of the finest cozening feates: in so much as there is a very formal art thereof devised, with many excellent superstitions and ceremonies thereunto belonging, which I will set down as briefly as may be. Albeit that here in England, this proverb has been current; to wit, Dreams prove contrary: according to the answer of the priest's boy to his master, who told his said boy that he dreamt he kissed his tail: Yea master (says he) but dreams prove contrary, you must kiss mine.",

        "content": "There must be made upon a hazel wand three crosses, and certain words both blasphemous and impious must be said over it, and hereunto must be added certain characters, & barbarous names. And while the treasure is a digging, there must be read psalms, _De Profundis, Missa, Misereatur nostri, Requiem, Pater noster, Ave Maria, Et ne nos inducas in tentationem, sed libera nos à malo, Amen. A porta inferi credo videre bona, &c. Expectate Dominum, Requiem æternam._ And then a certain prayer. And if the time of digging is neglected, the devil will cary all the treasure away. See other more absolute conjurations for this purpose, in the word Iidino following. \n\nYou will find in Johannes Baptista Neapolitanus, diverse receipts by herbs and potions, to procure pleasant or fearful dreams; and perfumes also to that effect; who affirms, that dreams in the dead of the night are commonly preposterous and monsterous; and in the morning when the gross humors are spent, there happen more pleasant and certain dreams, the blood being more pure than at other times: the reason whereof is there expressed.",
