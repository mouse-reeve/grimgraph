Stand before the stick toward the rising of the sun,, take hold thereof, in the name of God, with both hands, and speak: Stick, I grasp thee, in the name of God the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit, that thou shalt be obedient to me, that I may surely hit him whom I design to whip. Whereupon take thy knife, and cut the stick in three cuts, while pronouncing the three highest names, and carry it quietly to thy home, and guard it well, that no person steals it. If you intend to whip a witch which hath assaulted a beast or human being, go into the resp. house, and pray, before proceeding thence, three times, with great devotion, the article dedicated to the Bedgoblin, (which is the second article in this book), so that she may be destroyed by fire, and no evil spirit may enter into house or stable; otherwise the cats would get madam to scratch the eyes out of your head. Then move round the man or beast so bewitched three times, back­ward. Now take off the hat, put it upon the floor, and batter so long upon the hat as thou may chose. It will certainly hit the witch; and even if you should hammer holes into your hat, even the witch will then receive holes in his (or her) head. If thou desirest to flog one who is living at a distance from you, who deserves a beating, then place your coat upon a witch's ladder or shears, or upon a threshold, and call the name of him (or her) you design to whip, and you will hit him (or her) just as well as if he (or she) be present. But upon the stick thou must inscribe: Abiam, Dabiam, Fabiam. Probatum est!

Hereby is to be noted:

1. A child born on such a day will not live long, and if it lives, it will be of poor health and vigor.

2. If persons marry on any of these days, they will be apt to separate,, and live in quarrel and poverty.

3. If a person commences a voyage on such a day, he will generally return home sick, or meet with an accident in body or goods.

4. On such days do not commence to build, sell no young cattle, nor sow or plant anything. Do what you may, it will all come to trouble.

5. During these mentioned forty-two days, five days are es­pecially unlucky days, on which no journey should be taken, namely: The 3d of March, the 17th of August, the 1st, 2d and 30th of September. To this must be again noted thereof, three days are especially unlucky days, and any man shedding blood on such a day will surely die within seven or eight days there­after, as namely:

The 1st of April, on which Judas the traitor was born. 

The 1st of August the devil was rejected from heaven.

The first of December Sodom and Gomorrha was destroyed.

Whoever is born on any of these unhappy days, he will die of a violent death, or will be disgraced before the world, and seldom reaches old ages.

When a Cow Loses her Use, how to Mark the Witch.

Milk such a cow on a Friday morning before sunrise. Take the milk-pail, turn it over, and milk over the bottom of the pail two, three or four times, until you obtain a few pots of milk. Then you will also have to procure nine small pieces of wood, which you must either steal or beg for God's sake, but you may return them afterward. Then make a fire, take an iron pan, wherein boil the milk, in which put three tufts of hair of the cow, one from between the horns, one from the shoulder-bone, one from the loins. Thereafter take a handful of salt and a half handful of chimney soot. Now take three, spades or three scythes, heat them in fire and temper them off in the milk, turn them crosswise therein. Then take a hog's bladder, put the milk therein, and hang in the smoke.

If this does not help, write the characters upon spade or scythes as follows:—B. D.

To Quench Burning Thirst and Inward Heat.

Take a drachm of white eyestone mixed with a quart of fresh well-water and shake it until the water becomes entirely white. If it should be preferred sweet, white sugar may be added. To drink at meal times and during the day will allay the burning thirst and great heat.

For a Seated Stomach.

Take one pint of white rose vinegar, one half pound of sugar, boil these in a very clean brass pan, as long as it takes to boil a soft egg, and use it instead of salt to the meat at meal time. It is a good sauce, healthy and agreeable.

Also: Take a fresh or dried cherry into the mouth and keep the stone on the tongue, it restrains violent thirst at home and abroad. Further: The sour fibres of grape vines will also quench the thirst. Also: A piece of pectine chewed and kept during the entire day in the mouth, while traveling, is good to still the thirst.

For Feverish Thirst.

Before retiring at night, make a julep of quince roses or sorrel juice. But in lieu of these take rose sugar, and make a julep thereof, or drink milk of almonds, or eat raisins. These things will cause an easy rest and sleep, and strengthen the heart and liver. Also: The juice of currants, or a julep of strawberry juice, are excellent for quenching the thirst.

For Bronchitis.

If a person is troubled with great heat of the body, and to have bronchitis, such a person must receive attention inwardly  as well as outwardly. In the first place, apply the recipe of white eyestone as given above. The mouth has to be cleaned three times per day with the domestic powder.

When bronchitis, however, has developed itself, (it may in some cases be used from the commencement of the disease,) bruise house-leak leaves, press them through a cloth, take mornings after rising, and evenings before laying down, three spoonfuls of the juice, with as much goat's milk, it will soothe the pain, and alleviate the disease.

Note.

A horse affected with this disease, feed evenings and morn­ings with pure oats, and give it for a drink a pail of pure water. When the horse takes its mouth out of the water, hold a clean dish under its mouth, in order to catch all the water that runs out of the mouth again, therein; this water strain through a cloth, and give to the sick two or three spoonfuls thereof, and rinse the mouth with the domestic powder. Henry de Kaltenthal has used it during war times, and became fully convinced of its curative qualities.

Another Remedy for the Bronchitis.

Take three male crabs, but no female, pound them alive in a mortar, pour three spoonfuls of white vinegar thereon, then press the juice through a cloth, and take it evenings before retiring to bed. Wet a woolen cloth therewith, rinse the mouth thoroughly with it, and gargle with such water. If it does not help at once, continue the cure for two or three days in succession.

Another Remedy for the Same Disease.

Take fresh turnips, grind them on the grater, press the juice out, and with it rinse the mouth frequently. In lieu of fresh turnips, dried ones will answer the same purpose. A handful of these boil in a quart of water, wherewith rinse and gargle the mouth and throat frequently. It does not matter if the patient should swallow some of this, it allays the heat. 

Still another Remedy for the Above Disease.

Put dried quinces in fresh water, gargle the throat there­with, and let it remain awhile in the mouth. It cools and purifies well. But if such quinces can be obtained, grate them upon a grater, put them in well-water and apply as stated. The best remedy, however is the following, which may be had at all hours. Take a quart of fresh well-water, a quart of small raisins, two ounces brown rock candy, ten figs, some licorice root cut fine, and five fall roses (white are the-best). Take twelve leaves of small sage, let all of these articles boil, about as long as eggs have to boil, then take it off the fire.

For the White and Bloody Dysentery.

As soon as a person notices the approach of this disease, put, wherever you have to go, two or three handfuls of salt there­in, and let it stand thus over night. This do on the first day.

Also: Then take some gold filings, as much as salt is used in an egg, put into a chicken broth. It strengthens mightily. Pearls prepared for twelve hours, and as much taken thereof as salt is used to an egg, also in chicken broth, also the same quantity of corals, it strengthens and increases the appetite. Meanwhile, burn rye-bread water in the following manner:

Take rye bread, as warm as it comes from the bake-oven, break it into pieces, but do not cut it. The bread put into a distilling apparatus, and distil quickly water therefrom, the faster the better. As soon as you have gathered three spoon­fuls, take it; the remainder save in a well corked phial. As soon as these breadcrumbs have been put into the flame of a coal fire, let some one else break or crumble the crusts fine, put them in a tin can, be the same large or small, just as you may desire, a smaller or larger quantity of water; then fill the pot with red wine, let it stand over night, and the next day distil water therefrom.

In case the dysentery will not cease, give of this water to an infant a few drops thereof; to a child ten years old, one spoonful, and to an adult from five to six spoonfuls per day.

When the patient becomes visibly weaker, give him daily gold, pearls and corals to take, according to directions as above. This will strengthen his heart. While the flux prevails,  the strength of the patient is waning. The wine for the patient must be An accordance to his state of weakness, it must not be too much loaded with gold nor too sour or too strong.

All nourishment to be given to the patient should be of a binding nature. At the same ratio as the red flux ceases, the nourishment of a binding nature should also cease in propor­tion. Before a convalescent takes any food, let him first try some good old rose sugar or old quinces, and if the stomach is very sore and weak, try some old quince jelly.

If the patient feels chilly, add six spoonfuls of malvasier to this jelly. In want of this article take a good, strong, old wine. Let this boil over the fire, put it upon a piece of white leather, apply it to the navel as hot as it can be borne. When­ever the patient wishes to eat, remove the plaster, but after the meal apply it again to the stomach. This plaster is good for eight days and strengthens the stomach.

In case all the above given remedies avail nothing, or the dysentery increases rapidly, while the bread water is being prepared, take a three-finger pinch of pulvis rhei in wine or warm broth twice per day.

For Griping Pains and Straining.

Rarely ever is dysentery without griping pains or strain­ing. In such cases the patient should have every night, before retiring to bed, a quart of warm goat's milk sweetened with sugar. The dish into which the goat's milk is to be milked, must be made warm before milking. Hence it is necessary that the goat's milk be near at hand; whenever such milk gets cold it must not be warmed. This beverage quenches the thirst, gives nourishment, heals the injured intestines, and soothes the strains. It may be drank as long as the pain lasts.

In case the griping pains do not yet cease, the patient should have three or four drops of scorpion oil rubbed over the navel. If this does not help either, then take matronis vulgaris, cut them off from the stem a span high, strip flowers and herbs from the stem, perhaps a good handful, cut them fine, add an egg thereto, also two spoonfuls of flower and three spoonfuls of vinegar, stir it well together and bake it in lard or olive  oil until it resembles that of a cake. Then put it as warm as you can stand it upon the navel, and put a cloth folded four times over it. When it becomes cold warm it again in the lard or oil, as before mentioned. With God's aid this will prove beneficent.

To secure Natural Sleep and Rest.

Take oil of mace and rose salve, of one as much as of the other; mix well ? together; with this anoint the temples, the neck, the nostrils, the pulses on both arms, and the soles of the feet. Repeat this several days in succession before retiring to bed. It brings on the natural sleep.

Remedy. against the Biting of Rabid Dogs.

The St. Petersburgh Miscellaneous Essays for the Science of Pathology, volume of 1511, relates the following: Morachetti, operator in a hospital in Moscow, who, while sojourn­ing in the province of Ukrain, was requested one day to ren­der medical aid to fifteen persons, all of whom had been bit­ten by a mad dog. While he was preparing for the necessary arrangements, there appeared a committee composed of sev­eral old persons, who came to beseech the doctor to permit a certain peasant to attend to the unfortunate patients, since this peasant had obtained a great celebrity for many years, by his successful healing of hydrophobia.

The prayer having been granted, the peasant gave to four­teen of the sick a strong decoction of sumit and fl. genista luteæ tinctoriæ, (one and one-half of a pound daily), and ex­amined them twice daily, under their tongues, where, as this farmer said, little knots would form containing the poisonous matter. As soon as these knots in reality appeared (of which Dr. Marochetti convinced himself satisfactorily), they were opened and cauterized with a red hot needle, whereupon the patient had to gargle his throat with the decoction of the geniate. The result of this was, that the fourteen, (of which only two, which had been bitten last, did not show these knots), were discharged after six weeks' cure in an entirely healthy condition.

A little girl, however, the fifteenth of the bitten party, who had been treated in the usual way, was attacked on the sev­enth day by hydrophobia, and died eight hours after its ap­pearance. Those who had been thoroughly cured, Dr. Maro­chetti saw three years afterward and all of the fourteen were hale and hearty. 

Five years after this occurrence, Dr. Marochetti had occa­sion to verify this important discovery in Podolia. He was en­trusted with the treatment of twenty-six persons who had been bitten by a rabid dog. The sick were composed of nine men, eleven women and six children. A decoction of genista was forthwith prepared and the attentive examination of the tongues resulted as follows: Five men, all the women and three children showed the mentioned little knots, those who had been severely wounded, already on the third day, the oth­ers on the fifth, seventh and ninth day respectively. One pa­tient, a woman, who had received but a slight bite on the leg, showed only on the twenty-first day, the appearance of the knots. Even those seven on whose tongues these knots never appeared continued to drink the decoction for six weeks and all of them were cured. These knots must, however, be opened within twenty-four hours of their appearance, or the poison may return to the other parts of the body, and the patient would thus be helplessly lost.

MISCELLANEOUS PARCHMENTS, CONSISTING OF RARE, OLD MANUSCRIPTS FOUND AMONGST THE EF­FECTS OF ALBERTUS MAGNUS, AND SUPPOSED TO HAVE BEEN WRITTEN BY HIM.
Of Magical Suspensions and Alligations; showing how, and by what power they receive Virtue, and are efficacious in Natural Magic.

When the soul of the world, by its virtue, does make all things (that are generated, or artificially made) fruitful, by sealing and impressing on them Celestial Virtues for the work of some wonderful effect, then things themselves not only applied by collyry, or suffume, or ointment, of any other such like away; but when they are conveniently bound to, or wrapped up, or suspended about the neck, or any other way applied, although by ever so easy a contract, they do im­press their virtue upon us: by the alligations, etc., therefore, the affinities of the body and mind are changed into sickness or health, valor, fear, sadness or joy, and the like; they ren­der those that carry them, gracious, terrible, acceptable, re­jected, honored, beloved, or hateful and abominable.

Now these kinds of passions are conceived to be infused no otherwise than is manifest in the grafting of trees, where the vital life and virtue is communicated from the trunk to the twig engrafted in it, by way of contact and alligation; so in the female palm tree, when she comes near to the male, which the gardener seeing, he binds them together by ropes across, but soon becomes straight, as if by the continuation of the rope she had received a propagating virtue from the male. And it is said, if a woman takes a needle, and bewray it with dung, and put it up in earth in which a carcass has been buried, and carry it about her in a piece of cloth used at a funeral, no man can defy her as long as she carries it.

Now, by these examples, we see how, by certain alligations of certain things, also suspensions, or by the most simple con­tact of continuation of any thread, we may be able to receive some virtues thereby; but it is necessary to know the cer­tain rule of magical alligation and suspension; and the manner  that the art requires in this, viz.: that they must be done under a certain and suitable constellation; and they must be done with wire, or silken threads, or sinews of certain animals; and those things that are to be wrapped up, are to be done in the leaves of herbs, or skins of animals, or membraneous parchments, etc. For, if you would procure the solary virtue of anything, this is to be wrapped up in bay leaves, or the skin of a lion, hung round the neck with gold, silk, or purple or yellow thread; while the sun reigns in the heavens, so shalt thou be endured with the virtue of that thing. So if a saturine quality or thing be desired, thou shalt in like manner take that thing, while Saturn reigns, and wrap it up in the skin of an ass, or in a cloth used at a fun­eral, especially if melancholy or sadness is to be induced, and with a sad, or ash, or leaden, or black silk of thread, hang it about thy neck; and so in the same manner we must pro­ceed with the rest distinctly and progressively.

Of Antipathies; of Actives and Passives; of Stones, Fishes, Rivers, etc., of the Wonderful Celestial and Terrestrial In­fluences, Etc.

It is necessary, in this place, to speak of the antipathies of natural things, seeing it is requisite, as we go on, to have a thorough knowledge of that obstinate contrariety of Nature, when anything shuns its contrary, and drives it, as it were, out of its presence.

Such antipathy as this has the root rhubarb against choler; molasses against poison; the sapphire stone against hot biles, feverish heats, and diseases of the eyes; the amethyst against drunkenness; the jasper against the bloody-flux and offensive imaginations; the emerald, and agnus caftus against lust; achates, or agates, against poison; poiny against the falling sickness; coral against the ebullition of black choler, and pains of the stomach; the topaz against spiritual heats, such as are covetousness, lust, and all manner of love excesses.

The same antipathy is there, also, against the dandelion against the herb organ, and the wing of a bat, and the heart of a lap-wing, from the presence of which they fly. Also the organ is contrary to a certain poisonous fly which cannot resist  the sun, and resists salamanders, and loathes cabbage with such a deadly hatred that they cannot endure each other. So they say cucumbers hate oil. And the gall of a crow makes even men fearful, and drives them from it with horror.

A diamond disagrees with a loadstone; that being present, it suffers no iron to be drawn to it. Sheep avoid frog-parsley as a deadly thing; and what is more wonderful. Nature has depicted the sign of this antipathy upon the livers of sheep, in which the very figure of frog-parslay does naturally appear. Again, goats hate garden basil, as if there was nothing more pernicious.

And, amongst animals, mice and weasels disagree; so a lizard is of a contrary nature to a scorpion, and induces great terror to the scorpion with its very sight, and they are therefore killed with oil; which oil will likewise cure the wounds made by scorpions. There is a great enmity between scorpions and mice; therefore, if a mouse be applied to the bite of a scorpion, he cures it. Nothing is so much an enemy to snakes as crabs; and if swine be hurt by them, they are cured by crabs: the sun also, being in Cancer, ser­pents are tormented. Also, the scorpion and crocodile kill one another; and if the bird Ibis does but touch a crocodile with one of his feathers, he makes him immovable. The bird called a bustard flies away at the sight of a horse; and a hart will bound forward at its greatest speed at the sight of a ram, or a viper.

An elephant trembles at the hearing of the grunting of a hog; so does a lion at the crowing of a cock; and a panther will not touch them that are anointed with the fat of a hen, especially if garlic had been put into it. There is also an enmity. between foxes and swans; bulls and jackdaws. And some birds are at a perpetual variance, as daws and owls; kites and crows, turtle and ring-tail; egepis and eagles; also, harts and dragons. Amongst water animals, there is a great antipathy between dolphins and whirlpools; the mullet and pike; lamprey and conger; pourcontrel and lobster, which latter, but seeing the former, is nearly struck dead with fear; but the lobster tears the conger. The civet-cat cannot resist  the panther; and if the skins of both be hung up against each other, the skin or hairs of the panther will fall off.

Apollo says, in his hieroglyphics, if any one be girt about with the skin of a civet-cat, he may pass safe through his enemies. The lamb flies from the wolf; and if the tail, skin, or head of lupus be hung up in the sheep's cot, they cannot eat their meat for very fear. And Pliny mentions the bird called the marlin, that breaks the eggs of the crow, whose young are annoyed by the fox; that she also will pinch the whelps of the fox, and the fox likewise, which, when the crow sees, they help the fox against her as against a com­mon enemy. The linnet lives in, and eats thistles; yet she hates the ass, because he eats the thistles and flowers of them. There is so great an enmity between the little bird called esalon and the ass, that their blood will not mix; and that, at the simple braying of an ass, both the esalon's eggs and young perish together.

There is, also, a total antipathy of the olive-tree to the harlot; that, if she plant it, it will neither thrive nor pros­per, but wither. A lion fears lighted torches, and is tamed by nothing sooner. The wolf fears not sword or spear, but a stone; by the throwing of which a wound being made, worms breed in the wolf. A horse fears a camel so much that he cannot endure a picture of that beast. An elephant, when he rages, is quieted by seeing a cock. A snake is afraid of a naked man, but pursues one clothed. A mad bull is tamed by being tied fast to a fig-tree. Amber attracts all things to it but a garden-basil, and things smeared with oil, between which there is a natural antipathy.

Of the Occult Virtues of Things which are Inherent in them only in their Lifetime, and such as Remain in them oven after Death.

It is expedient for us to know that there are some things which retain virtue only while they are living, others even after death. So in the colic, if a live duck be applied to the belly, it takes away the pain, and the duck dies. If you take the heart out of any animal, and, while it is warm, bind  it to one that has a quartan fever, it drives it away. So if any one shall swallow the heart of a lapwing, swallow, weasel, or a mole, while it is yet living and warm with natural heat, it improves his intellect, and helps him to remember, under­stand, and foretell things to come.

Hence, this general rule: That whatever things are taken for magical uses from animals, whether they are stones, members, hair, excrements, nails, or anything else, they must be taken from those animals while they are yet alive, and, if it is possible, that they may live afterward. If you take the tongue of a frog, you put the frog into water again; and Democritus writes, that if any one shall take out the tongue of a water-frog, no other part of the animal stick­ing to it, and lay it upon the place where the heart beats of a woman, she is compelled against her will, to answer what­soever you shall ask of her. Also, take the eyes of a frog, which must be extracted before sunrise, and bound to the sick party, and the frog to be let go again blind into the water, the party shall be cured of ague; also, the same will, being bound with the flesh of a nightingale in the skin of a hart, keep a person always wakeful.

Also, the roe of the fork fish being bound to the navel, is said to cure bowel pains, if it be taken from it alive, and the fish put into the sea again. So the right eye of a serpent being applied to the soreness of eyes, cures the same; if the serpent be let go alive, and afterward let go, cures the tooth­ache; and dogs will never bark at those who have the tail of a weasel that has escaped. Democritus says: that if the tongue of the chameleon be taken alive, it conduces to good success in trials, and likewise in love affairs.

There are many properties that remain after death; and these are things in which the idea of the matter is less swal­lowed up, according to Plato, in them even after death, that which is immortal in them will work some wonderful things — as in the skins we have mentioned of several wild beasts, which will corrode and eat one another after death; also, a drum made of the rocket-fish, drives all creeping things at what distance soever the sound of it is heard. 

Of Sorceries — Their Wonderful and Truthful Power — Of Witchcraft, Etc.

The force of Sorceries are, no doubt, very powerful; indeed they are able to confound, subvert, consume, and change all inferior things; likewise there are sorceries by which we can suspend the faculties of men and beasts. Now, as we have promised, we will show what some of these kinds of sorceries are, that, by the example of these, there may be a way opened for the whole subject of them. Of these, the first is a cer­tain kind of blood, which, how much power it has in sorcery, we will now consider:

First, if it comes over new wine, it will turn it sour; and if it does but touch a vine, it will spoil it forever; and, by its very touch, it renders all plants and trees barren, and those newly set, die; it burns lip all the herbs in the garden, and makes fruit fall from trees; it makes dim the beauty of polished ivory, and makes it rusty; it likewise makes brass rusty, and to smell very strong; by the taste, it makes dogs run mad, and, being thus mad, if they once bite any one, that wound is incurable; it destroys whole hives of bees, and drives them away, if it does but touch them; it makes linen black that is boiled with it; it makes mares cast, by touching them with it; it makes asses barren, if they eat of the corn touched by it. The ashes of clothes when cast upon purple garments, that are to be washed, change their original color, and likewise take away the color and fragrance of flowers.

It also drives away tertian and quartan agues, if it be put into the wool of a black ram, and tied up in a silver bracelet; as also if the soles of the patient's feet be anointed there­with, and especially if it be done by the person (him or herself), the patient not knowing what she uses. It likewise cures the falling sickness; but most especially it cures them that are afraid of water or drink after they are bitten by a mad dog, if only such a cloth be put under the cup. Like­wise, if a person shall walk with it in their hand, before sunrise, in a field of standing corn, all hurtful things perish; but if after sunrise, the corn withers; also, they are able to  expel hail, rain, thunder and lightning; more of which Pliny mentions. Know this, that if they happen at the decrease of the moon, they are a much greater poison than in the in­crease, and yet much greater if they happen between the decrease and change; but if they happen in the eclipse of the sun or moon, they are a most incurable and violent poison. But they are of the greatest force when they happen in the first years, for then if they but touch the door-posts of a house, no mischief can take effect in it. And some say that the threads of any garment touched therewith is hard to burn, and if they are cast into a fire, it will spread no farther. Also it is noted, that the root of piony being given with castor, and smeared over with such a cloth, it cureth the falling sick­ness.

Again, let the stomach of a hart be roasted, and to it be put a perfume made with a cloth of this kind; it will make cross-bows unless for the killing of any game. The hairs of a camel, put under dung, breeds serpents; and if they are burnt, will drive away serpents with the fume. So great and powerful a poison is in them, that they are a poison to pois­onous creatures.

We next come to speak of hippomanes, which, amongst sor­ceries, are not accounted the least; and this is a little venomous piece of flesh, the size of a fig, and black, which is in the forehead of a colt newly foaled, which unless the mare herself does presently eat, she will hardly ever love her foals, or let them suck; and this is said to be a most powerful phil­ter to cause love, if it be powdered, and drunk in a cup with the blood of him that is in love; such a potion, it is supposed, was given by Medea to Jason.

The civet-cat, also, abounds with sorceries; for the posts of a door being touched with, her blood, the arts of jugglers and sorcerers are so invalid, that evil spirits can by no means be called up, or be compelled to talk with them — this is Pliny's report. Also, those that are anointed with the oil of her feet being boiled with the ashes of the ankle bone of the same and the blood of a weasel, shall become odious to all. The same, also, is to be done with the eye being decocted. If any one has a little of the strait-gut of this animal about him, and  it is bound to the left arm, it is said to be a charm for all true love affairs, and to withstand witchcraft.

We next come to speak of the blood of a basilisk, which magicians call the blood of Saturn. This procures (by its virtues) for him that carries it about him, good success of petitions from great men; likewise makes him amazingly successful in the cure of diseases, and the grant of many privileges. They say, also, that a tick, if it be taken out of the left ear of a dog, and be altogether black, if the sick person shall answer him that brought it in, and who, standing at his feet, shall ask him concerning his disease, there is certain hope of life; and that he shall die if he makes him no answer. They say, also, that a stone bitten by a mad dog causes discord, if it be put into drinks; and if any one shall put the tongue of a dog, dried, into his shoe, or some of the powder, no dog is able to bark at him who has it; and more powerful this, if the herb hound's tongue be put with it. And likewise, dogs will not bark at him who has the heart of a dog in his pocket.

The red toad (Pliny says), living in briers and brambles, is full of sorceries, and is capable of wonderful things; there is a little bone in his left side, which being cast into cold water, makes it presently hot; but which, also, the rage of dogs are restrained, and lovers' quarrels disposed of, if it be put in their drink, and makes servants faithful and service­able.

On the contrary, the bone which is on the right side makes hot water cold, and it binds so that no heat can make it hot while it there remains. It is a certain cure for ague if it be bound to the sick, in a snake's skin; and likewise cures all fevers, the St. Anthony's Fire, and restrains unholy de­sires. And the spleen and heart are effectual antidotes against the poisons of the said toad. Thus much has Pliny written.

Also, it is said, that the sword with which a man has been slain possesses wonderful power; for if the snaffle of a bridle, or bit, or spurs be made of it, with these a horse ever so wild is tamed, and made gentle and obedient. They say, if we dip a sword with which any one was beheaded, in wine,  that it cures the chills and fevers, the sick being given to drink of it. There is a liquor made, by which men are made as raging and furious as a bear, imagining themselves in every respect to be changed into one; and this is done by dis­solving or boiling the brains and heart of that animal in new wine, and giving any one to drink out of a skull, and while the force of the draught operates, he will fancy every living creature to be a bear like to himself; neither can anything divert or cure him till the fumes and virtue of the liquor are entirely expended, no other distemper being perceivable in him.

The most certain cure of a violent headache, is to take any herb growing upon the top of the head of an image, the same being bound, or hung about one with a red thread, it will soon allay the violent pain thereof.

To Cause several kinds of Dreams.

Now we will endeavor to show how to cause pleasant, sad, or true dreams. But that we may more certainly effect it, it will be good first to know the causes. The meat in con­coction must be corrupted (this must be taken for granted) and turned into vapors; which, being hot and light, will nat­urally ascend, and creep through the veins into the brain; which being always cold, condenses them into moisture, as we see clouds generated in the outer world; for by an inward reciprocation, they fall down upon the heart, the principal seat of the senses. In the meanwhile, the head grows full and heavy, and is overwhelmed in a deep sleep. Whence it comes to pass, that the species descending, meet and mix with other vapors, which make them appear preposterous and monstrous; especially, in the quiet of the night. But in the morning, when the excrementious and soul blood is separated from the pure and good, and become cool and allayed; then pure and unmixed, and pleasant visions also appear. Wherefore, I thought it not irrational, when a man is overwhelmed with drink, that vapors should arise participating, as well of the nature of what he has drank or eat, as of the humors which abound in his body, that in sleep he should rejoice or be much troubled; that fires and darkness, hail and putrefactions,  should proceed from cholera, melancholy, cold and putrid humors. So to dream of killing any one, or being besmeared with blood, shows an abundance of blood; and Hippocrates and Galen say, We may judge a man to be of a sanguine complexion by it.

Hence, those who eat windy meats, by reason thereof, have rough and monstrous dreams; meats of thin and small vapors exhilarate the mind with pleasant phantoms. So also the out­ward application of simples, does infect the species while they are going to the heart. For the arteries of the body, says Galen, while they are dilated, do attract into themselves any­thing that is next them. It will much help too, to anoint the liver; for the blood passes upward out of the stomach by evaporation, and runneth to the liver; from the liver to the heart. Thus the circulating vapors are infected, and represent species of the same color. That we may not please the sleepers only, but also the waking, behold.

To Soften the Teeth, and to make them Sound and White.

Macerate the leaves of mastick, rosemary, sage, and bram­ble, in Port wine; then distil it with a gentle fire through a retort; take a mouthful of this, and stir about, till it turns to spittle; it fastens the teeth, makes them white, and restores the gums "The root of pellitory bruised, and put into the teeth, takes' away the pain; so does the root of henbane.

Of the Wonders of Natural Magic — Sympathetic and Occult.

Some of the wonders of Magic we mean to display. But here we hasten to investigate by what means, instruments, and effects, we must apply actives to passives, to the produc­ing of rare and uncommon effects. Therefore, to begin with things more simple: If any one shall, with an entire new knife, cut asunder a lemon, using words expressive of hatred, contumely or dislike, against any individual, the absent party, though at an unlimited distance, feels a certain inexpressible and cutting anguish of the heart, together with a cold chilli­ness and failure throughout the body;— likewise of living animals, if a live pigeon be cut through the heart, it causes the heart of the party intended, to become affected with a sudden failure;— likewise fear is induced by suspending the magical image of a man by a single thread; also death and destruction by means similar to these; and all these from a fatal and Magical Sympathy.

Likewise the virtues of simple animals, of which we shall speak. The application of hare's fat pulls out a thorn;— likewise any one may cure the toothache with the stone that is in the head of the toad. Also, if any one shall catch a living frog before sunrise, and he or she spits in the mouth of the frog, will be cured of an asthmatic consumption — like­wise the right or left eye of same animal helps blindness; and the fat of a viper cures a bite of the same. Black hellebore easeth the headache, being applied to the head, or the powder snuffed up the nose in a moderate quantity. Coral is a well-known preservative against witchcraft and poisons, which, if worn around children's necks, enable them to combat many diseases. Paracelsus and Helmont both agree that the toad has a natural aversion to man, and his idea of hatred he carries in his head and eyes, and throughout his whole body; that the toad may be prepared for a sympathetic rem­edy, disorders, such as the Chills, Epileptic Fits, etc., and that our terror and natural hatred be more strongly imprinted in the toad, we must hang him in a chimney by the legs, and set under him a dish of yellow wax, to receive whatever may come down, or fall from his mouth; let him hang in this position, in our sight, for three or four days, at least till he is dead; not omitting to be present in sight of the animal, so that his terror and hatred of us may increase even to death.
